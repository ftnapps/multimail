Description of MultiMail patches

-- Version 0.43 released --

Patch 1067:

To ListWindow::KeyHandle() in basic.cc; added '|' as equivalent for '^'.
To class help; same.

Rationale:

'^' is a poor choice on some European keyboards. Reported by Peter Karlsson.
'|' copied from blueMail. (I did have '*', but '|' makes more sense.)

Patch 1068:

To ListWindow::KeyHandle(); moved main filter routine here. To derived
classes; added setFilter(), removed filter setting from extrakeys().

Rationale:

Eliminate redundant code.

Patch 1069:

To LittleAreaListWindow::setFilter(); added call to init().

Rationale:

The filter was not working correctly here (even in 0.43).

Patch 1070:

To myreaddir() and mystat::init() in mysystem.cc; added calls to findclose(),
ifdef'd for Win32.

Rationale:

In the Win32 version, under NT (though not 9x), the temporary directories
were not being deleted. To Do: Overhaul the temp dir system?

Patch 1071:

To addrbook.cc, tagline.cc, and lettpost.cc; changed ShadowedWin inits with
COLS - 2 to COLS - 4.

Rationale:

See patch 1062. I still need to sort this out properly.

Patch 1072:

To DEFRAR and DEFUNRAR in resource.cc; added "-inul".

Rationale:

To supress output, for consistency with the Zip lines. I noticed the output
because I finally encountered an actual RARed packet -- seemingly now the
default (?) for Sursum Corda. (Or if not the default, at any rate, my
archiver setting was somehow changed to RAR there.)

Patch 1073:

To LetterListWindow::setFormat(); simplified assignment of topformat. To
::MakeActiveCore(); eliminated topformat. To LetterWindow::UpdateHeader();
eliminated format[] and sformat[] strings. To ::DrawStat(); etc. To
AnsiWindow::statupdate(); similar.

Rationale:

I just learned about the '*' parameter for the printf() family. Doh!
