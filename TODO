In no particular order:

- The name -- should it be changed? I've found several unrelated programs
  that also go by the name "MultiMail".

- The system of key commands needs to be rationalized. Especially after
  all the extra keys I added. :-}

- Better support for new file list, welcome, goodbye, etc.

- Provide threaded view.

- Redo the compress/uncompress configuration to allow adding new types 
  without recompiling.

- Make character translation more flexible.

Here are some of the To Do items from previous versions:

-----------------

Plans for the future:

   * new features (filter by sender/topic, etc..)
   * support for unix mail
   * support for usenet
   * save letters in packet format or in the formats above
   * easy use of PGP, UUdecode, etc...
   * X interface

and we accept any good ideas ...
