${h3}0.42 - 2001/12/08:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}CTRL-E instead of 'E' now forces invocation of the addressbook when
${indent}entering a message in a non-netmail, non-email area. This only gets you
${indent}the real name portion. I don't really see the use of this myself -- the
${indent}entire point of the addressbook is to store netmail and email addresses,
${indent}not simple names -- but it was requested, and easy to do, so here it is.
${indent}It works wherever 'E' works (area list, letter list, letter window),
${indent}although due to space considerations and laziness, it only appears in the
${indent}letter list's help menu. Note that you can still only use the 'L' function
${indent}of the addressbook on messages where an address is present. (Changing that
${indent}would be more involved.) Suggested by Greg Sears.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}In the Win32 version, under Windows XP and perhaps 2000 (?), the window
${indent}was scrolled up on returning from a shell (unarchiving, etc.), unless the
${indent}scrollback buffer was disabled. Although cosmetic, this was enough of a
${indent}nuisance that I'm releasing 0.42 now.

${bullet}Added strings.h to the includes in mmail.h to get it to compile under QNX.
${indent}(If you're trying this, edit the Makefile to say \"-lncurses\" rather than
${indent}\"-lcurses\".) Note that the background characters (ACS_BOARD and
${indent}ACS_CKBOARD) aren't what they should be in QNX; otherwise, it works well.

${bullet}New error message for the case when no files are found in the work
${indent}directory after uncompression, but no error code was returned by the
${indent}unarchiver. (Previously this resulted in the misleading message \"Packet
${indent}type not recognized\"; that message is now reserved for times when there
${indent}are actually some files in the work directory.)

${bullet}Since version 0.38, when I moved development to a new computer, the
${indent}documentation file \"mm.txt\", included with the DOSish ports, had not been
${indent}converted correctly by the script that builds those archives -- it was
${indent}left as raw troff code instead of a rendered man page, and the line
${indent}endings were left as LF (Unix style). In other words, it was basically
${indent}illegible. The discouraging part of this is that no one reported it, which
${indent}makes me think that no one's reading the documentation. :-(

${bullet}Other, minor updates to the documentation.
${ulend}
${h3}0.41 - 2001/10/16:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Options can now be specified on the command line. Any .mmailrc option may
${indent}be used, though not all will actually work (some of them are used in
${indent}initialization before this point). Options are preceded by '-' or \"--\",
${indent}and must finish before a packet is specified. See the man page for more
${indent}details.

${bullet}New keyword: \"IgnoreNDX\". This makes MultiMail ignore the *.NDX files in
${indent}QWK packets, in favor of the new (slower, but safer) indexing method that
${indent}uses only MESSAGES.DAT. Turn this on if you get bogus *.NDX files from
${indent}your BBS (as seems all too common).
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Big bug: Reply splitting in QWK on DOSish systems (DOS, Win32, OS/2)
${indent}generated a corrupt reply packet (always). It's been this way a long time;
${indent}possibly since the message split feature was introduced. I never noticed
${indent}it because a) I rarely split messages, b) I seldom use QWK anymore -- all
${indent}SOUP and BW now, c) I never use the DOSish ports, except for testing, and
${indent}d) the split replies _look_ OK, until you close and reopen the packet. I
${indent}had a lot of bug reports which, in retrospect, seem to be about this, but
${indent}I never got enough detail to make sense of the problem, until Ken Hrynchuk
${indent}reported on it. Many thanks to him.

${bullet}Bogus values in the *.NDX files of a QWK packet are now checked for and
${indent}often handled without having to abort. In some cases, MultiMail is able to
${indent}revert to the alternate indexing method automatically; in others, the
${indent}message \"ERROR READING MESSAGES.DAT\" appears in the letter list, instead
${indent}of the gibberish that resulted when following a bogus pointer. For those
${indent}cases which still cause problems, see the new \"IgnoreNDX\" keyword.

${bullet}Problems with the ncurses configuration on Mandrake 8 (well, on my system,
${indent}anyway) caused MultiMail to hang on searches or ANSI animation. There's
${indent}now a partial workaround for this (searching works OK, ANSI anim still
${indent}hangs) in MultiMail. But the proper fix is this: Download the ncurses
${indent}source; configure; manually edit the line in curses.h that defines bool to
${indent}say \"typedef unsigned char bool\" instead of \"typedef unsigned bool\";
${indent}compile; and install. I still have to figure out why the typedef comes out
${indent}that way; the same version of ncurses (with the same configure script)
${indent}works correctly on my old Slackware system. You might see this problem on
${indent}other systems as well.

${bullet}Blue Wave messages with Internet kludge lines (as produced by version 4
${indent}doors) were causing segfaults. This is what happens when a feature doesn't
${indent}get exercised for a while. :-(

${bullet}Segfault on a message with a MSGID kludge line, but no other body text.

${bullet}In the Win32 port, packet time stamping now works under Win 9x, though it
${indent}still doesn't work on network shares under NT.

${bullet}Some unprintable characters weren't being filtered out when running in an
${indent}xterm, resulting in a garbled display.

${bullet}In the 16-bit port, in QWK packets with no *.NDX files, MultiMail was
${indent}failing if the MESSAGES.DAT file was larger than 32K.

${bullet}The END key now works under screen (for example) with ncurses.

${bullet}The message-splitting function now uses parentheses instead of brackets,
${indent}and the part number is padded with leading zeroes. I did this to match
${indent}standard practice in the alt.binaries.* newsgroups.

${bullet}Added the undocumented option \"-#\" to the default command lines for PKZip
${indent}and PKUnzip. This supresses output, equivalent to the \"-q\" option used in
${indent}the default InfoZip command lines. Suggested by K.H. (Note that if you're
${indent}upgrading, you'll have to put it in manually, if you want it; as always,
${indent}MultiMail won't alter values that are already specified in its config
${indent}file.)

${bullet}Shelled commands (zip, unzip, edit) can now handle paths with spaces in
${indent}them.

${bullet}On MultiMail's first run, on DOSish systems, the MMAIL.RC ended up with
${indent}paths that had a mix of slash and backslash characters. Although this
${indent}didn't interfere with operation, it was a cosmetic defect.

${bullet}The defaults in the top-level Makefile have changed to \"${lt}curses.h${gt}\" for
${indent}CURS_INC, and \"-lcurses\" for LIBS. Most/all distros of Linux, as well as
${indent}FreeBSD, have replaced the older curses with ncurses by now, and some
${indent}(e.g., Debian) lack the old-style compatibility links, so this now seems
${indent}to be the most widely compatible configuration. (The old defaults are now
${indent}in the first commented-out example section.)

${bullet}I figured out the problem that led to the hasty release of version 0.40 --
${indent}it was a missing pair of parentheses. ${lt}sigh${gt} Or to look at it another way,
${indent}a misunderstanding of operator precedence.
${ulend}
${h3}0.40 - 2001/04/15:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Nothing new this time.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Undid one part of the BSOC, which (perversely enough, since this is exactly
${indent}what it was intended to cut down on) was causing crashes in the Win32, XT,
${indent}and OS/2 ports. I still haven't nailed down WHY it was doing this, but I
${indent}isolated the source of the trouble by brute-force analysis. :-( I promise
${indent}better testing next time.

${bullet}Useless mouse code now omitted in DOS, XT and OS/2 ports. (Yes, I hope to
${indent}actually support the mouse on these platforms eventually. First, mouse
${indent}support has to be added to their respective ports of PDCurses.)
${ulend}
${h3}0.39 - 2001/04/13:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Mouse functionality. Currently, this is only supported under X (with
${indent}either ncurses or PDCurses), in the Linux console with gpm, and in the
${indent}Win32 port. See the man page for a description of how to use this -- not
${indent}well-described there, but it should be fairly intuitive.

${bullet}A new flag to join Marked, Replied, Read and Private: Saved. It's set
${indent}automatically when a message is saved (natch). It appears in the letter
${indent}list as a lowercase 's', and as a new flag in the group displayed in the
${indent}letter window. (Note that if the message is also Marked, only the 'M' will
${indent}appear in the letter list -- I was short of columns.) Because of this, the
${indent}names displayed in the letter window have been shortened. Saving a message
${indent}no longer marks it as Read, since that seems redundant now (though it
${indent}still does clear the Marked flag). The new flag is mapped appropriately in
${indent}.XTI files, but not in MAIL.FDX, so it's not preserved in OPX packets.

${bullet}New transparency method: The transparent background color is the one
${indent}specified by \"Main_Back\" in the colors file, rather than always black.
${indent}This allows the use of transparency with light backgrounds, etc. (See the
${indent}screenshots web page.)
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}A longstanding bug: It was impossible to rename packets after opening
${indent}them. Finally fixed, as part of a big string-operation cleanup.

${bullet}Another longstanding one, also part of the BSOC: On some platforms, when
${indent}specifying a packet name on the command line, names of certain lengths
${indent}wouldn't work. After I finally sorted this out, the surprising thing was
${indent}that it had ever been working for names of any length. ${lt}sigh${gt}

${bullet}Many potential buffer overflows and bogus limits fixed in the BSOC. Others
${indent}remain. :-(

${bullet}Since time immemorial: When pulled from the address book into a message,
${indent}the \"To:\" field was being restricted to 29 characters, regardless of packet
${indent}type. Also, the length of names in the address book had been limited to 44
${indent}characters.

${bullet}A fresh one: Reply packets were being stamped with a bogus date.

${bullet}The packet list, if sorted by time, is no longer rearranged when a packet
${indent}is Touched.

${bullet}Replies are now preserved in the event of a crash during the write-out
${indent}process. Inspired by Matt Munson.

${bullet}The highlight bar wasn't showing up in XCurses -- probably since about
${indent}version 0.18, which shows how often I try that port. (I also had some
${indent}other problems with XCurses, as yet unsolved; it sometimes locked up on
${indent}starting.)

${bullet}Stupid bug in SOUP: segfault on message areas with 8-character filenames.

${bullet}The line showing \"BBS:\" and \"Sysop name:\" in the area list is now omitted
${indent}if neither is defined (as in SOUP packets), leaving an extra line for the
${indent}areas themselves.

${bullet}The minimum screen size is now 60x17. I'm shooting for 40 columns. ;-)
${ulend}
${h3}0.38 - 2001/02/03:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}First new version in over seven months! See, it's not dead after all.

${bullet}Transparency: There are three new keywords in the .mmailrc which are
${indent}mainly for making the background transparent, for use in programs like
${indent}Eterm which can put an image in the background: \"UseColors\" (default:
${indent}yes), \"Transparency\" (default: no), and \"BackFill\". \"Transparency\" only
${indent}works in ncurses; \"BackFill\" is the only one available on all platforms.
${indent}See the man page for more on these.

${bullet}New date/timestamp handling: When updating packets with the .red markers,
${indent}MultiMail now preserves the original timestamp of the file. This means
${indent}that date sorting will reflect the order in which packets arrived, rather
${indent}than the order in which they were last read. (Note, however, that this
${indent}feature doesn't quite work correctly in the Win32 port (see README.win).
${indent}One way around this would be to use PKZIP with the \"-k\" option; or just
${indent}use the DOS port.) Inspired by Ingo Brueckl. At first I had this toggled
${indent}by a keyword, but then...

${bullet}The complement to the new timestamp handling is the 'T' function in the
${indent}packet window, which \"Touches\" a file, setting its timestamp to the
${indent}current time. I needed this because I actually depend on the timestamps
${indent}being updated sometimes.

${bullet}New \"ExpertMode\" option supresses the help text, for those who are
${indent}familiar with the commands and would rather use more of the screen for
${indent}text. Four lines are gained in the packet, area and letter lists, among
${indent}other gains.

${bullet}In a related note, you now can gain seven lines in the packet list by
${indent}undefining VANITY_PLATE in config.h, but this is strictly a compile-time
${indent}option. :-)

${bullet}OPX secretly restored. ;-)
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Removed several older keywords to simplify the .mmailrc: BuildPersArea
${indent}(even on my XT, it didn't really take much longer), MakeOldFlags,
${indent}UseScrollBars, and AutoSaveRead (all these are now always on).

${bullet}The default editor for the Win32 port is now \"start /w notepad\". I'm not
${indent}crazy about this, but under NT (in VMware), EDIT was completely locking
${indent}up. Unfortunately MS provides no text-mode, native Win32 editor. (BTW, an
${indent}interesting aside: Under NT, \"notepad\" is actually sufficient (the calling
${indent}program waits for it to return); the \"start /w\" bit is for the benefit of
${indent}9x, which otherwise launches notepad and returns immediately.)

${bullet}The Win32 port had trouble with the most recent Win32 version of PDCurses,
${indent}because it now returns shift, alt and control immediately as keystrokes.
${indent}(XCurses presumably had the same problem, but I didn't test this.) This is
${indent}worked around now.

${bullet}SOUP (and BW v4): Newsgroup lines which exceed the width of the display
${indent}now end in \"...\" to indicate a continuation. (You can see the entire
${indent}\"Newsgroups:\" line by pressing 'X' for full headers.)

${bullet}SOUP (and BW v4?): Broken \"References:\" lines which contained no proper
${indent}message ID's were causing segfaults. Reported by Peter Karlsson. BTW,
${indent}would the perpetrators of these broken messages please fix them?

${bullet}SOUP: In 'm' mode, checking for \"From \"-line dividers is a little more
${indent}rigorous; the line must now also contain an '@'. This eliminated all the
${indent}false positives I was seeing on Pine-generated mail folders.

${bullet}In packets where the list of subscribed areas is not known (e.g., all
${indent}plain QWK and SOUP packets), the \"Subscribed\" mode in the area list is now
${indent}skipped automatically.

${bullet}The default color scheme is now a little less day-glo, :-) and shows up
${indent}better on some terminals. The old one is still available in tradit.col.
${indent}Let me know what you think.

${bullet}Ncurses' built-in SIGWINCH handler is on by default in 5.0+; this was
${indent}conflicting with MultiMail's handler. It should now work OK, but see
${indent}NCURSES_SIGWINCH in interfac.h if you're not using ncurses' defaults.

${bullet}When going backwards through messages via '-' and backing out of an area,
${indent}the display was not updated correctly. I've also changed the behavior of
${indent}'-' in this instance to go back to the last non-empty group instead of the
${indent}last group (more consistent with '+').
${ulend}
${h3}0.37 - 2000/06/28:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Moved web site and email from ClarkNet to SourceForge. Among other
${indent}benefits, this means that old versions of the MultiMail source code are
${indent}now archived online, going back to 0.1. Binaries (for certain platforms)
${indent}from 0.36 on will also be archived.

${bullet}New compression type: tar/gz. (New .mmailrc keywords: \"tarCompressCommand\"
${indent}and \"tarUncompressCommand\".) Unlike the other types, this recompresses the
${indent}entire packet when updating the .red flags, so it can be a bit slow. Also,
${indent}the supplied command lines assume GNU tar, which has gzip built-in.
${indent}Separated gunzip/tar and tar/gzip command lines would require a (simple)
${indent}external script. MultiMail only checks for the gzip signature. Requested
${indent}by Peter Karlsson for compatibility with GNUS.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}The packet list could crash on directory names longer than 32 characters.
${indent}Reported by Tuukka Lehtinen.

${bullet}Zero-length messages caused a segfault. Reported by T.L.

${bullet}In SOUP packets with index files, the .idx file would be opened instead of
${indent}the corresponding .msg file. Reported (indirectly) by Peter Karlsson.

${bullet}GNUS apparently uses a bogus identifier 'n' in the first position of the
${indent}attribute fields of the AREA files in the SOUP packets it generates,
${indent}equivalent to the standard type 'u'. MultiMail now recognizes this flag.
${indent}Reported by P.K.

${bullet}In MakeChain(), rejoin is now always applied to non-quoted lines. This
${indent}looks better in most cases; in particular, where space padding on the end
${indent}of a line resulted in a line of exactly 80 columns. (Previous versions of
${indent}MultiMail would print an extra blank line then.)

${bullet}relist() is now always called from MakeActive() in the area list and
${indent}little area list. This means that the list is updated properly in Active
${indent}mode, among other things.

${bullet}In the packet list search function, the wrong packet was highlighted.

${bullet}On some platforms (including the NetBSD m68k binary distributed on the web
${indent}site), forced word-alignment of structs broke the \"old-style\" (.PDQ-based)
${indent}offline config in Blue Wave mode. (Yes, I should've anticipated this after
${indent}the similar bug with OPX mode in 0.32.)

${bullet}The signature-adding routine will now skip CR characters, so (in
${indent}principle) a .sig could be shared between Unix and DOSish readers. Other
${indent}text files should still be kept separate. Inspired by Martin Prieto.

${bullet}The backslashes that had briefly appeared in the DOSish versions' packet
${indent}windows had reverted to forward slashes again in 0.36. :-)
${ulend}
${h3}0.36 - 2000/04/28:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}The area list has a new mode, \"Active\", to accompany the existing \"All\"
${indent}and \"Subscribed\" views. The Active mode lists only those areas that
${indent}contain messages. The L key now cycles among all three modes. (Note that
${indent}in some cases, two modes may be equivalent; e.g., in plain QWK packets,
${indent}there's no way to distinguish Active from Subscribed.)

${bullet}There's also a new \"Marked\" view in the letter list. If any messages in
${indent}the area are marked, the L key cycles between all, unread, and marked
${indent}views. (Otherwise, it toggles all/unread, as before.) Marked messages are
${indent}no longer automatically included in the unread view.

${bullet}In the packet and letter lists, the current sort modes are now displayed.
${indent}And in the area and letter lists, the current mode is displayed. The
${indent}number of files is shown in the packet list, but only if the total number
${indent}of items (files + directories) exceeds the window length. The area and
${indent}letter lists now work similarly, showing the number of items only when
${indent}they exceed the window length.

${bullet}By popular demand, the default modes for the area list (all, subscribed,
${indent}or active) and the letter list (all or unread) can now be set in .mmailrc.
${indent}See the \"AreaMode\" and \"LetterMode\" keywords.

${bullet}Old-style Blue Wave offline config, using .PDQ files, is now supported.
${indent}(.UPI/.NET replies still aren't, yet.) Requested by Russell Tiedt.

${bullet}Specifying a directory on the command line now opens the packet window on
${indent}that directory. No more items are read from the command line afterwards.

${bullet}In Unix, the \"~\" character is now recognized as a synonym for the contents
${indent}of the \"HOME\" environment variable in input, and is also used that way in
${indent}the packet list display. (However, \"~username\" is not supported.)

${bullet}The Tab key works as an alternative to Enter in input windows.

${bullet}The BCC port is now the \"standard\" Win32 port. (The RSX/NT port is still
${indent}available, renamed mmrsxNNN.zip.)

${bullet}New BeOS binary.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Makefile.tcc and Makefile.bcc are now sensible -- no more renaming or
${indent}moving kludges. :-) Also, the \"UNUSED_PARAMS\" nonsense is gone, and
${indent}MultiMail compiles without warnings under BCC.

${bullet}The message and ansi viewers can now handle ${gt} 64k in the 16-bit version,
${indent}depending on available memory.

${bullet}In myreaddir(), the DJGPP, Turbo and Borland ports (mmdos, mmxt, and
${indent}mmwin) now use findfirst()/findnext() instead of readdir()/stat(). This
${indent}means that the packet window opens significantly faster on large
${indent}directories. (stat() is fine in Unix, but slow in MS-DOS, where it's
${indent}implemented via findfirst().) Also, the list is now built in a single
${indent}pass, instead of one pass for files and another for directories, resulting
${indent}in a speedup on all platforms.

${bullet}Test of read-only status now works in Borland/Turbo ports.

${bullet}Grabbing of Fidonet addresses was broken in some situations, causing
${indent}segfaults. Reported by Greg Paski.

${bullet}When lines ended with spaces, they could be quoted incorrectly. Reported
${indent}by Jim Hanoian.

${bullet}Tab characters in messages could cause segfaults in some cases.

${bullet}Soft CR stripping wasn't working.

${bullet}Looking through my (very) old packets, I found some in which another
${indent}reader (?) had added its own files to a packet with the names \"a0000.ndx\"
${indent}and \"a0001.ndx\", which made MultiMail generate a bogus area 0 for those
${indent}packets. Fixed.

${bullet}The keypad mostly didn't work in the BCC (Win32) port of MultiMail.
${indent}Reported by Jeff Foy.

${bullet}Using the Goto function in the packet list now puts the highlight bar on
${indent}the first file, as when a directory is selected by pressing Enter. In Lynx
${indent}mode, going left (back) in the packet list now actually goes to the
${indent}previous directory, instead of the parent directory, and the previous
${indent}highlight position is restored.

${bullet}When cycling through sort modes in the letter list, sort by \"To:\" is now
${indent}skipped for areas which have no such field (i.e., Usenet areas).

${bullet}Wrapped header lines in SOUP are now displayed in the correct color.

${bullet}When writing out offline config (add/drop), the area list was scanned, but
${indent}the current area number was not preserved. This sometimes led to minor
${indent}cosmetic problems in the reply area. Reported by J.H.

${bullet}Finally replaced the ugly #define list in mmcolor.h with an enum.

${bullet}Some malformed Internet \"From:\" lines appear without a space between the
${indent}name and address. In such cases, MultiMail was stripping the last letter
${indent}of the real name.

${bullet}Several new error messages.

${bullet}The color files are now archived separately within the binary archives, to
${indent}reduce clutter. Now if I can just figure out how to combine some of the
${indent}documentation files in a sensible way...
${ulend}
${h3}0.35 - 2000/03/29:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}None.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Oops! Due to the changes in the way LetterWindow::MakeChain() works, quote
${indent}wrapping was broken. (Lines after wrapped lines would not be wrapped
${indent}upwards, nor marked with quote marks.) A five-second fix, but alas, I
${indent}didn't notice the bug until now.
${ulend}
${h3}0.34 - 2000/03/29:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Two new ports officially supported: An alternate Win32 port, via Borland
${indent}C++ 5.5 (available free at the Borland web site); and, more interestingly,
${indent}a 16-bit MS-DOS port, via Turbo C++ 3.0 (an ancestor of Borland C++ 5.5).
${indent}I released an experimental version of the latter a couple weeks ago, but
${indent}the official 0.34 version is much better, mainly in reducing memory usage
${indent}and in not (always) giving up when memory runs out. :-)

${bullet}Areas that have replies are now always included in the short list, which
${indent}prevents the replies being misdirected on re-edit. Such areas are also now
${indent}flagged with an 'R' in the main area list.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}The \"References:\" line disappeared from SOUP replies if they were
${indent}re-edited before posting. Reported by J.B. Moreno.

${bullet}Massive reductions in memory usage for the LetterWindow and AnsiWindow
${indent}classes. The plain message text takes up about half as much space as
${indent}before; the ANSI viewer savings vary, but can be even greater.

${bullet}The environmental variable \"TEMP\" now works as an alternative to \"TMP\"
${indent}with the DJGPP port. If neither of those is defined, nor \"DJGPP\", it will
${indent}now use the startup directory instead of \"C:\\\".

${bullet}TEMP or TMP values ending in a slash or backslash now work correctly in
${indent}the Win32, OS/2 and 16-bit MS/DOS ports. Also, all these ports now use the
${indent}startup directory rather than the MMAIL directory as the default location
${indent}for the temporary directories and files, in the absence of a TEMP or TMP
${indent}environment variable.

${bullet}SOUP replies sometimes had the wrong length in the length field (one byte
${indent}too long), resulting in spurious characters at the ends of messages.

${bullet}Skip trying to add to read-only files. (But this check doesn't work yet in
${indent}the Borland/Turbo ports.)

${bullet}References to \"interface\" in the code changed to \"ui\". (Apparently,
${indent}\"interface\" is a reserved word in Borland C++.)

${bullet}Soft CR stripping moved to the Blue Wave class. Let me know if this is a
${indent}problem. (I haven't seen them in QWK or OMEN packets, and they'll never
${indent}appear in SOUP.)

${bullet}Various code cleanup. Now 16-bit clean, among other things. :-)
${ulend}
${h3}0.33 - 2000/02/21:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Support for encoding and decoding Quoted-Printable headers and bodies,
${indent}primarily in SOUP packets. Decoding is always performed; encoding is
${indent}performed subject to the new .mmailrc keywords \"outCharSet\", \"UseQPHead\",
${indent}\"UseQPMailHead\", \"UseQPNewsHead\", \"UseQPMail\" and \"UseQPNews\". Thanks to
${indent}Peter Karlsson for some of the code.

${bullet}Support for the OPX format has been removed. I hope this will be only
${indent}temporary. The reason is not technical. If you're affected by this, and
${indent}you'd like to continue using OPX, please email me privately.

${bullet}Support for individual packet types may now be disabled when compiling, in
${indent}order to save a little space in the executable. The packet modules to
${indent}include are selected in the \"modules\" file.

${bullet}The Rename function in the packet list now brings up a Blue Wave-style
${indent}default filename, with a numeric extension based on the last one found
${indent}plus one, unless the packet already has a numeric extension. Also, rename
${indent}failures are reported, and you can no longer rename to the name of an
${indent}existing file.

${bullet}Some extra pop-up notices like \"Opening...\", mainly for the benefit of
${indent}slower systems. :-) There are also additional non-fatal error messages in
${indent}several places, as when a Save fails.

${bullet}.XTI support is now fully segregated into the Blue Wave module. This is
${indent}cleaner, but it means that .XTI files are only recognized in Blue Wave
${indent}packets, and not in other types. The default for the \"MakeOldFlags\" option
${indent}in .mmailrc has been changed to \"Yes\".

${bullet}The automatic prefixing of \"Re: \" on the subjects of replies can now be
${indent}disabled, for non-Internet areas only, via the \"ReOnReplies:\" .mmailrc
${indent}keyword. By popular demand. :-)

${bullet}New color scheme contributed by Tuukka Lehtinen.

${bullet}Before the removal of the OPX module, these features were added:

${bullet}In OPX mode, MAIL.FDX is now handled in the same way as .XTI in Blue Wave
${indent}mode. It's written instead of .red when \"MakeOldFlags\" is set.

${bullet}Offline config in OPX mode. Thanks to Armando Ramos for the format.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}\"To:\" and \"From:\" kludge lines in text are now checked only in QWKE
${indent}packets, instead of all QWK packets. This should help with some systems
${indent}that require \"To:\" lines for Internet addressing.

${bullet}Blue Wave anonymous areas are now recognized as alias areas, as in QWKE.

${bullet}Areas flagged as read-only will no longer accept replies, and will pop up
${indent}an error box instead. This works in Blue Wave, QWKE, and OMEN. Requested
${indent}by Jaakko Lintula.

${bullet}The MS-DOS version sometimes segfaulted due to bugs in DJGPP's qsort().
${indent}Fixed by upgrading to a newer DJGPP library. Reported by Laird Kelly.

${bullet}When reading the .mmailrc file, unrecognized keywords are now reported.
${indent}May help to catch typos. :-)

${bullet}In OMEN mode, when the UserName was not set in .mmailrc, all messages were
${indent}being flagged as personal.

${bullet}Defaults for \"AutoSaveReplies\" and \"AutoSaveRead\" changed to \"Yes\".

${bullet}Compiling on an Alpha revealed several bugs that didn't show up on systems
${indent}where pointers and ints were the same size (i.e., all the 32-bit systems);
${indent}mainly inappropriate usage of resource::get() vs. ::getInt(). MultiMail is
${indent}now 64-bit ready. :-) Thanks to Compaq for the free account.

${bullet}In Blue Wave mode, the echotag field is now used as the area description
${indent}if the description field was left blank. Problem reported by Greg Mayman.

${bullet}Internet address parsing modified to deal with badly-formed addresses like
${indent}\"(Name) ${lt}address${gt}\". Problem reported by Dane Beko.

${bullet}There were intermittent segfaults in the letter window with screens wider
${indent}than 80 columns, due to an off-by-one error in memory allocation.

${bullet}The following fixes were made to the OPX module prior to its removal:

${bullet}Some versions of the Silver Xpress door eat the last character of the tear
${indent}line. MultiMail now pads it out with a sacrificial space in OPX mode.
${indent}Reported by Jim Hanoian.

${bullet}Some OPX packets split their areas into BRDINFO.DAT and EXTAREAS.DAT;
${indent}MultiMail should now be able to handle this (untested). Reported by
${indent}Armando Ramos.

${bullet}On some platforms (e.g., the NetBSD version distributed on my site), OPX
${indent}support was not working due to structure alignment padding. Fixed.

${bullet}New line ending recognized: plain CR. (This is in addition to the LF,
${indent}CRLF, and 0x8D endings recognized in 0.32.) If you got messages with blank
${indent}bodies, or immediate segfaults when opening messages, this will probably
${indent}fix it. Reported by Laird Kelly.

${bullet}Certain packets (with messages over 64k?) reportedly had incorrect values
${indent}in the length fields of some messages, causing everything after that point
${indent}to become unreadable. This is fixable by using MAIL.FDX to index the
${indent}messages, which MultiMail now does. Reported by Armando Ramos.
${ulend}
${h3}0.32 - 1999/10/30:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Support for the OPX packet format. This was reverse-engineered, and has
${indent}really only been tested with the WINS door. See mmail/opxstrct.h in the
${indent}source code archive for the specs.

${bullet}A \"Personal\" area (messages addressed to you) is now created automatically
${indent}for all packet types except SOUP. This can be turned on or off (default is
${indent}on) via the \"BuildPersArea\" option in the .mmailrc -- except in QWK
${indent}packets with .NDX files, where the presence or absence of a \"personal.ndx\"
${indent}file determines whether the area is generated (the same as in older
${indent}versions of MultiMail).

${bullet}With Blue Wave packets (and _only_ with Blue Wave packets), MultiMail now
${indent}has the option (off by default) of storing its last-read pointers in an
${indent}\".xti\" file, as used by the Blue Wave reader and some compatible programs
${indent}(like BWSave), instead of in MultiMail's native \".red\" format. This is
${indent}toggled by the \"MakeOldFlags\" option in the .mmailrc. (I made the name
${indent}generic in anticipation of support for other such formats, like OPX's
${indent}\"mail.fdx\".) In reading, .red no longer takes precedence over .xti; if
${indent}both files are present, the one with the later date is used.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Character set translation now works correctly on Linux text consoles that
${indent}use Unicode-mapped fonts. Problem reported by Peter Karlsson. Also, OMEN
${indent}replies to Latin-1 packets were not recognized as being Latin-1 on
${indent}rereading; initial printing of translated fields in the header editor was
${indent}incorrect; and the ANSI viewer always assumed CP437.

${bullet}Forwarded messages now add only the changed header lines to the body of
${indent}the text, instead of using the same format as saved messages.

${bullet}Date in SOUP replies was being localized, which is undesirable. Reported
${indent}by P.K.

${bullet}The Personal area now always shows the correct number of unread messages
${indent}in the area list.

${bullet}Blank lines are now added automatically before signatures, and the sigdash
${indent}(\"-- \") in Internet and Usenet areas is correctly followed by a newline
${indent}before a sig. (Previously, it worked right with taglines, but not sigs.)

${bullet}Areas with a very long description could cause a segfault when opening the
${indent}letter list. (They were truncated, but not quite enough since the addition
${indent}of the message count.) Also, the header of the letter list now takes
${indent}advantage of the full width of larger screens.

${bullet}Can now read net-status QWK packets correctly, even without .NDX files.
${indent}(End users shouldn't really be reading net-status QWK packets; but judging
${indent}by a packet I was sent, some are.)

${bullet}Empty subject lines are now forced to the end of the letter list when
${indent}sorting by subject, instead of messing up the sorting as they were doing.

${bullet}Precautionary fix for hypothetical corrupted Y2K date fields in Blue Wave
${indent}packets. Hopefully not needed. :-)

${bullet}The User-Agent line in SOUP mode now includes \"SOUP\" in the comment. :-)
${ulend}
${h3}0.31 - 1999/10/07:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}When a new version is run for the first time, instead of prompting whether
${indent}to continue or quit, it prompts whether to edit the .mmailrc file or just
${indent}continue. Should save a step. ;-)
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Text files (e.g., MMAIL.RC, or the DOOR.ID or CONTROL.DAT from a QWK
${indent}packet) which did not end in a line feed character would cause MultiMail
${indent}to lock up. This was due to a new line-reading function introduced in
${indent}version 0.30, which fixed some other problems, but stupidly added this
${indent}one. Due to the seriousness of this bug, I'm releasing 0.31 early.
${indent}Reported by David Pratt et al.

${bullet}Searching did not work in the little area list. (This dates to 0.29,
${indent}though I just noticed it.)

${bullet}In SOUP packets, extra spaces between header keywords and values are now
${indent}ignored.
${ulend}
${h3}0.30 - 1999/09/30:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Support for SOUP packets. Note that type 'M' areas and index files are not
${indent}supported yet; only 'm', 'b' and 'B'.

${bullet}Support for OMEN packets.

${bullet}The new keywords \"UserName\" and \"InetAddr\" are used to build a default
${indent}\"From:\" line for SOUP replies, of the form \"UserName ${lt}InetAddr${gt}\". If you
${indent}leave them blank, no \"From:\" line will be generated. (Conforming SOUP
${indent}packers, like UQWK, will generate their own \"From:\" lines in that case.)
${indent}The UserName is also used in OMEN mode for display purposes (the actual
${indent}From name is set on upload), and for matching personal messages.

${bullet}Replies in Usenet areas may now be cross-posted; the newsgroups list can
${indent}be edited.

${bullet}Quote headers can now be set in the config file (separately for Internet/
${indent}Usenet areas, and others), via the \"QuoteHead\" and \"InetQuote\" keywords.
${indent}The maximum width for quoted material can also be set, via \"QuoteWrapCols\"
${indent}(suggested by Holger Granholm). See the man page for details.

${bullet}The \"Lines:\" indicator now includes a percentage.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Long lines in text files would sometimes cause the remainder of the file
${indent}to be read incorrectly. Mainly, this could show up with the tagline file.
${indent}Reported by Dane Beko. Also, blank lines in the tagline file are now
${indent}ignored.

${bullet}Area 0, if present, was not being sorted in the letter list.

${bullet}In the MS-DOS version, the first shell-out would trash the old prompt, so
${indent}second and subsequent shells had a bogus prompt. Reported by Jerel
${indent}Arbaugh.

${bullet}When re-editing a reply and shortening it, the remaining text could end up
${indent}off the screen when returning from the editor. Reported by Jim Hanoian.
${indent}Also, a similar effect could be briefly seen when editing a reply from the
${indent}original, if the reply was shorter.

${bullet}Text entry fields did not work correctly when backspacing if the text
${indent}filled the field. Reported by Tom Rutherford.

${bullet}Changed default zip commands -- removed \"-o\" (for both PKZIP and InfoZip)
${indent}and added \"-k\" for InfoZip. The latter option forces stored pathnames to
${indent}an MS-DOS compatible 8.3 unicase format, which ensures maximal
${indent}compatibility with doors and such. You may want to add this yourself if
${indent}you're upgrading; but note that it could result in two \".red\" files being
${indent}stored into packets that had been read without this option.

${bullet}Saved messages can now have longer header lines, and the headers are more
${indent}appropriate (closer to what you see in the letter window) for Internet/
${indent}Usenet areas.

${bullet}Signatures and/or tearlines in Internet/Usenet replies are now prefaced
${indent}with \"-- \", and \"... \" is omitted. Signatures are recognized in text in
${indent}these areas, are colored with the tagline color (I'll make this a separate
${indent}color later), and are not quoted when replying.

${bullet}Long subject lines and other long lines can now be fully edited,
${indent}regardless of screen width, and will be fully displayed if the screen is
${indent}wide enough.

${bullet}In Internet/Usenet areas in Blue Wave packets, the subject, date and
${indent}newsgroups are now extracted from the kludge lines in the text, as with
${indent}references and message-id. (Most of the changes in this version of
${indent}MultiMail are for enhanced Internet/Usenet support; although this was
${indent}primarily for the benefit of SOUP, it carries over into Blue Wave.)

${bullet}TAB characters are now decoded into spaces in MakeChain(). This prevents
${indent}them from pushing lines off the screen. But to save a message with its TAB
${indent}characters intact, you have to save it from the ANSI viewer.

${bullet}Strip any number of leading \"Re:\"'s, not just the first.

${bullet}Filenames within reply packets are now created in upper case, even if you
${indent}don't use the \"-k\" option (see above). Mainly this was for compatibility
${indent}with the MBSE BBS, though there may be others with the same problem. (The
${indent}format specs generally show the filenames in upper case, so this is
${indent}arguably the correct behavior for a case-sensitive filesystem; but most
${indent}were designed with the FAT filesystem in mind, and only SOUP explicitly
${indent}addresses the issue of case.)

${bullet}\"Re: \" will not be prepended if it would make the subject exceed the
${indent}maximum width for the format. Also, non-QWKE QWK packets now have their
${indent}subjects limited to 25 characters (again); the \"Subject:\" kludge will not
${indent}be added except in QWKE packets. (I'll add it back for some later, when I
${indent}can identify the particular door's capabilities better.)

${bullet}':' and '|' are now recognized as quote indicators, but only when
${indent}appearing in the first column. (But if ':' is the start of a smiley, it's
${indent}ignored.)

${bullet}When quoting in Internet/Usenet areas, blank lines now have a quote marker
${indent}prepended, as this seems to be the standard.

${bullet}Intitial check for 80x20 instead of 60x20, error if screen too small.

${bullet}I made a (temporary) patch to PDCurses for the MS-DOS version, so that
${indent}MultiMail will work correctly in non-standard video modes. Problem
${indent}reported by J.A.

${bullet}Overdue documentation of the .mmailrc file in the man page.
${ulend}
${h3}0.29 - 1999/08/29:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}List windows now have a \"scroll bar\" when the number of items in the list
${indent}exceeds the number that will fit onscreen. This feature is selectable via
${indent}the \"UseScrollBars\" keyword in .mmailrc (on by default). Note that it's
${indent}not (yet) mouseable.

${bullet}The new \"UseLynxNav\" option (off by default) changes the function of the
${indent}left and right cursor keys: left backs out, and right selects. (It's named
${indent}after the Lynx web browser. The idea comes from Pine, which has a similar
${indent}option.) It also makes the left arrow equivalent to selecting \"..\" in the
${indent}packet list, except on the top level (where it's equivalent to Quit).

${bullet}Fido \"SEEN-BY:\" lines are now marked as hidden if they weren't already.
${indent}(This allows you to turn on the \"extended info\" option in Blue Wave doors
${indent}below ver. 4 with impunity.)

${bullet}The Delete key will work as an alias for 'K' in all cases.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Major bug: In certain cases, the little area list would not set the
${indent}correct area, and the reply would be misdirected. Reported by Jerel D.
${indent}Arbaugh.

${bullet}Outside of the packet/area/letter list, the search routine could abort in
${indent}some cases (i.e., '/' would simply not work). Reported by Jim Hanoian.

${bullet}If a message was saved (from the letter list) before any messages had been
${indent}viewed, it could be saved rot13'd!

${bullet}The \"soft CR\" filter was not working if the console character set was
${indent}Latin-1.

${bullet}Re-editing of replies from the original area could move the letter list
${indent}selection inappropriately (to the corresponding reply number).

${bullet}If the last-opened packet was deleted and replaced by another packet of
${indent}the same name, the old packet would be \"reopened\" even though it was gone.
${indent}Reported by Raymond Cool.

${bullet}Lines which contained a '^A' character, but _not_ at the beginning of the
${indent}line, were erroneously being marked as hidden.

${bullet}\"Re:\" is now left visible in the letter window, though still stripped from
${indent}the letter list. (In this, I emulate Tin.)

${bullet}During a search, the beep-on-personal would beep on each personal message
${indent}scanned, even when the corresponding message was not actually displayed.

${bullet}When shelling out, the prompt string could be truncated if it was
${indent}excessively long. Not really a bug -- I just hadn't believed that anyone
${indent}would actually have a prompt string that long. :-) Reported by J.D.A.

${bullet}Due to its placement at the start of a line, an instance of the word
${indent}\".mmailrc\" was interpreted as a control code and disappeared from the
${indent}formatted man page. Reported by Geoffrey Wilson.
${ulend}
${h3}0.28 - 1999/07/28:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Offline config! (Add/Drop only, at the moment.) For Blue Wave, QWKE, and
${indent}QWK (with DOOR.ID indicating Add/Drop support). See the man page for
${indent}details.

${bullet}The area list window now has additional status flags: '+' and '-' for
${indent}added/dropped, and '*' in the full list for subscribed areas. The little
${indent}area list has '*' also, and is now wider.

${bullet}A more advanced search routine. It will now (optionally) descend levels,
${indent}allowing even a full text search over multiple packets.

${bullet}The address book now allows direct entry, as well as editing of existing
${indent}addresses. The tagline window allows editing of existing taglines. (The
${indent}old function of the 'E' key in the tagline window has been moved to the
${indent}'A' key.)

${bullet}Reply splitting, both manual and (optionally) automatic.

${bullet}Quick exit from any screen via ^X.

${bullet}Command shell (for DOSish ports) via ^Z.

${bullet}Packets can now be specified directly on the command line, bypassing the
${indent}packet menu. (If multiple packets are listed, they will be opened in
${indent}sequence.)

${bullet}Better quote wrapping -- paragraphs are rewrapped, and second-level quotes
${indent}are not requoted (except in Internet/Usenet areas, which use a reduced
${indent}quote for second-level quotes).

${bullet}Optional stripping of \"soft carriage returns\" (those annoying accented i's
${indent}that sometimes appear).

${bullet}Optional beep in letter window when opening personal messages.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}The \"Yes/No\" prompt to keep old reply packets has been replaced by
${indent}\"Save/Kill\", to reduce the chances of deleting a packet by mistake (as can
${indent}happen when one is in the habit of hitting 'N' in response to the new
${indent}files or bulletins prompts). Suggested by several users.

${bullet}In all string input windows (those that use ShadowedWin::getstring()), a
${indent}backspace as the first character will now preserve the default text (if
${indent}any). I'm not sure if it's better this way or not, though.

${bullet}The tagline window was displayed improperly on a screen wider than 80
${indent}columns when scrolled up or down a line at a time.

${bullet}I've changed the message MultiMail shows the first time a new version is
${indent}run, to something I hope is clearer. Please note that MultiMail will never
${indent}wipe out the values from your old config file, only update the file with
${indent}new keywords (if any).

${bullet}When changing to a new directory (or on startup), the first file rather
${indent}than the first directory is highlighted.

${bullet}When composing a new message and not quoting, MultiMail no longer creates
${indent}a 0-byte temp file before launching the editor. (You probably won't notice
${indent}the difference, but I think it may address one bug report I got a while
${indent}back. For me, it makes pico say \"New file\" instead of \"Read 0 line\".)

${bullet}Some more egcs warnings fixed. (Odd; they should have appeared earlier.)

${bullet}Internal reorganization: Most non-ANSI, non-curses code is now in
${indent}mysystem.cc. I hope this may simplify porting to non-POSIX systems. Also,
${indent}part of interfac.cc was split off into basic.cc; and some stupid #define
${indent}and const int lists were replaced with enums.
${ulend}
${h3}0.27 - 1999/06/27:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}The little area list now has short-list capability, like the main area
${indent}list. Press 'L' to toggle it.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}In QWK reply packets, the binary conference number was not being included.
${indent}This made them incompatible with some doors (at least some versions of
${indent}Galacticomm's software, and probably EzyBBS). The problem goes back to
${indent}MultiMail's beginnings. I didn't notice it before now because most QWK
${indent}doors use the ASCII conference number instead. (There are redundant fields
${indent}in a REP packet.) Thanks to SparkAm@peyam.net for tracing the problem.

${bullet}The precompiled MS-DOS binary of 0.26 wouldn't work on machines without
${indent}FPUs, due to the FPU code linked in with the difftime() function in the
${indent}packet list. I've replaced this with an integral subtraction, which is
${indent}adequate for my purposes. Reported by Greg Mayman et al.

${bullet}curs_set() is now called from Win::cursor_on() and Win::cursor_off(),
${indent}regardless of the curses implementation. (Formerly, these lines were
${indent}ifdef'ed.) This is for compatibility with ncurses 5.0-beta1, which no
${indent}longer calls it from leaveok(). I'm told that Solaris curses doesn't,
${indent}either.

${bullet}A netmail address on a message would be retained if the message were
${indent}forwarded to a non-netmail area, and it would not be editable. Reported by
${indent}Jim Hanoian.

${bullet}The packet list window length is now variable for lists shorter than the
${indent}max, as with the letter list. The \"info\" window in the area list has been
${indent}merged into the main window. (The visible effect of this is that the lower
${indent}window no longer has a title.)

${bullet}Some internal reorganization.
${ulend}
${h3}0.26 - 1999/05/26:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Automatic saving of replies is now available via the \"AutoSaveReplies\"
${indent}keyword in .mmailrc. When this is enabled, MultiMail automatically
${indent}rewrites the reply packet after a reply is created, edited or killed. It's
${indent}similar to pressing \"F2\" or \"!\" after each event, but without the warning
${indent}window. I'm considering making this the default behavior for future
${indent}versions -- any comments?

${bullet}The \"AutoSaveRead\" keyword turns on automatic saving of the last read
${indent}markers when exiting a packet, bypassing the \"Save lastread\" prompt. (This
${indent}is another thing I might make the default.)

${bullet}Packets may now be renamed from the packet list window by pressing 'R'.
${indent}(This function can also be used to move them to different directories,
${indent}though you must specify the filename as well as the pathname of the
${indent}destination.)

${bullet}Directories are now shown in the packet list, and are navigable; or you
${indent}can specify a directory to jump to via the 'G' command. (On the DOSish
${indent}ports, the 'G' command is the only way to change drive letters.) The
${indent}current directory appears as the title of the packet list window. Note
${indent}that this change means that the old behavior of exiting when no packets
${indent}were found will effectively never occur.

${bullet}By popular request, multiple replies to the same message (in the same
${indent}reply packet) are now allowed. (This is a partial reversal of the change
${indent}in 0.24.) When re-replying, you're prompted to re-edit; if you say no, a
${indent}new reply is generated. Only the first of the existing replies will be
${indent}recognized for re-editing.

${bullet}When opening a packet, you're now prompted whether or not to keep any
${indent}existing replies.

${bullet}The tagline window can now be completely disabled via the \"UseTaglines\"
${indent}keyword in .mmailrc. Requested by Jack Pfisterer.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Re-editing replies from the reply area no longer forces a return to the
${indent}letter list. Instead, the re-edited letter is displayed.

${bullet}Cosmetic problems with the wrong area being displayed on the status line
${indent}(and the header window) during the reply process have been cleared up.

${bullet}The \"This will overwrite any existing reply packet\" warning from the F2
${indent}function is now supressed if there is no packet.

${bullet}MultiMail will now display a warning if the reply packet is not created,
${indent}or if the last read markers could not be saved. Also, it will pause for
${indent}two seconds after getting an error code from a program it shelled to
${indent}(archiver or editor) or attempted to shell to, so that any console error
${indent}messages from the system may (hopefully) be read.

${bullet}Speculative fix for reported problems with replies disappearing (which I
${indent}couldn't reproduce): calls to clearDirectory() now pass the name of the
${indent}working directory explicitly, rather than \".\".

${bullet}Added \"-e\" to the default add command for ARJ to supress pathname
${indent}inclusion. Suggested by Ken Whiton.

${bullet}The separate colors for the Search window have been eliminated, as the
${indent}Save dialog is now used for both (as well as for the new prompts in the
${indent}packet list).

${bullet}The \"F2, !: Make reply packet\" function is now available in the letter
${indent}list and letter window, as well as the area window.

${bullet}Shorter date format in the packet list; more space for long filenames.

${bullet}On Blue Wave messages with no taglines, a blank line is now inserted
${indent}before the origin line.

${bullet}Fixed errors (and some warnings besides) that made MultiMail 0.25
${indent}incompatible with egcs. Thanks to Tony Summerfelt for reporting the
${indent}problems and testing (and re-testing) the solutions.

${bullet}If there was a tagline in the message on screen, and you chose not to use
${indent}a tagline in the reply, the tagline from the original would be used
${indent}instead. Reported by David Toutant and J.F. (With the reorganized tagline
${indent}code, I've also reverted to having the tagline grabber pick the last
${indent}tagline in a message, instead of the first.)

${bullet}In Blue Wave mode, when the packet filename differed from the \"base name\"
${indent}(BBS id), the former was used for replies, when it should be the latter.
${indent}Reported by Jim Hanoian.

${bullet}After animating ANSI, MultiMail would loop on a non-blocking keyboard
${indent}check, sucking up CPU.

${bullet}As usual, lots of internal reorganization.
${ulend}
${h3}0.25 - 1999/03/19:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Support for Internet and Usenet messages in Blue Wave mode. (Note: AFAIK,
${indent}this is only supported by the Blue Wave version 4 door for PCBoard.) Also,
${indent}Internet addresses can now be taken into the address book.

${bullet}Character sets (either code page 437 or Latin-1) are now selected for each
${indent}area or message. The default character set is CP437 (as before), except
${indent}for Internet or Usenet areas (as marked by Blue Wave or QWKE flags), which
${indent}are Latin-1. The character set in individual Fidonet messages can be
${indent}overriden by the \"CHRS:\" or \"CHARSET:\" kludges. Replies are set according
${indent}to the default for the destination area.

${bullet}The console character set and the default sort types for the packet and
${indent}letter lists can now be set in the config file. The default packet sort is
${indent}now by time (latest first) instead of by name.

${bullet}The \"To\" field is now omitted from the letter list in Usenet areas and the
${indent}QWK Personal area. The \"From\" field is omitted in the REPLY area. This
${indent}leaves more room for the \"Subject\" lines by eliminating redundant info.

${bullet}Direct support for RAR archives. Note: there's a problem with this if you
${indent}read the same packets in, e.g., both Linux and DOS: RAR will save the last
${indent}read marker file twice (once in upper case, once in lower).

${bullet}More ANSI navigation: The ENTER key now works the same in the ANSI viewer
${indent}as in the letter window (advance to next message).

${bullet}The packet list can now be rescanned (to pick up new packets) by pressing
${indent}'U'.

${bullet}The message count now appears in the title bar of the letter list (like
${indent}the area count in the area list).

${bullet}New color scheme by Gary Gilmore.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}The alternate QWK private message flag, '+', was not being recognized.
${indent}Reported by Tom Rutherford.

${bullet}Changed the message that prompts to save replies to something I hope is
${indent}clearer. Suggested by Max Chamberlain.

${bullet}If the reply packet had a different archive type than the main packet,
${indent}MultiMail would attempt to use *that* archiver (the reply packet's) to add
${indent}the last-read markers to the main packet. The correct behavior is to use
${indent}the main packet's archive type when remaking the reply packet!

${bullet}When quoted material was wrapped, the wrapped lines would have trailing
${indent}spaces. These are now stripped.

${bullet}In the area and tagline lists, a completely blank line would sometimes
${indent}appear at the top of the list. (A long-standing bug, finally fixed.)

${bullet}Strip blank lines after hidden lines. (Blue Wave puts blanks after the
${indent}hidden headers in Usenet messages.)

${bullet}Fewer keys to hit in the header editor. :-) The cursor is now placed on
${indent}either the Subject or To line, as appropriate (you can still arrow up to
${indent}edit the other lines); and the \"Make message private?\" prompt is not
${indent}presented when sending to areas that are either all-public or all-private
${indent}(as indicated by Blue Wave or QWKE flags).

${bullet}Bizarre alignment bug in the EMX-based ports (OS/2 and Win32) caused
${indent}crashes on some QWK packets. Reported by Jim Hanoian.

${bullet}Source code reorganized somewhat... no more .a files.

${bullet}Blue Wave packets could have identical areanums in multiple areas.
${indent}Although this is an error, the Blue Wave reader handled it; now MultiMail
${indent}does as well. This is also a little faster. However, it assumes that the
${indent}mixRecords and INF area headers are sorted the same way, which I would've
${indent}preferred not to assume. Problem reported by Scott Jones.

${bullet}In 0.24, the new packet kill routine failed to exit after killing the last
${indent}packet, leaving garbage on screen. Reported by Gary Gilmore.

${bullet}A filename without an extension would mess up the display in the packet
${indent}list. A long-standing bug that I never really cared about, but which J.H.
${indent}mentioned.

${bullet}All directories are now omitted from the packet list.

${bullet}One more attempted cursor fix for the Win32 version.

${bullet}Minor display bug with messages 100,000 lines or longer. (Now OK up to
${indent}1,000,000.)

${bullet}In the EMX ports, in the letter sort by subject, the secondary sort by
${indent}message number was still broken. Reported by J.H.
${ulend}
${h3}0.24 - 1999/02/12:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}\"Save\" function in ANSI mode. This differs from the letter window save in
${indent}that no wrapping is performed, and no header is prepended. This is also
${indent}the only way to save bulletins and new file lists.

${bullet}New navigation in ANSI mode: the space bar and left and right arrow keys
${indent}now work in the same way as in the letter window. This also means the
${indent}interface for the bulletin viewer is slightly different: 'Q' exits from
${indent}the entire list, instead of just the current bulletin, and you can move
${indent}back and forth between bulletins as in the letter window.

${bullet}Multiple sort modes in the packet list: by date (latest first), and by
${indent}name. By name is still the default. \"\$\" toggles between them.

${bullet}Multiple sort modes in the letter list: by subject (still the default),
${indent}message number (i.e., no sort), from, or to. \"\$\" cycles through them.

${bullet}The help window at the bottom of the packet, area and letter lists can now
${indent}show multiple pages of options (similar to Pine's \"Other commands\" menu
${indent}function).

${bullet}When character set translation is on in the ANSI viewer, some IBM
${indent}characters are now mapped to curses equivalents, giving a better result on
${indent}non-PC terminals (e.g., xterm, vt100). This works best with the box-
${indent}drawing characters. The letter window still uses a plain ASCII mapping for
${indent}these characters.

${bullet}Pop-up help is now available in the ANSI viewer, as in the letter window.

${bullet}Messages can be forwarded from any area, with the original headers
${indent}preserved in the text.

${bullet}Support for the Win32 console via RSX/NT. See README.rsx if you want to
${indent}compile for this platform.

${bullet}Fidonet MSGID/REPLY kludge lines are now supported, in Blue Wave mode.

${bullet}Additional QWKE support -- in QWKE packets, the short list now shows
${indent}\"subscribed-to\" conferences, as in Blue Wave mode, instead of just the
${indent}non-empty ones; and alias areas are supported. The \"QWKE\" type appears in
${indent}the Info window of the area list.

${bullet}When Replying to a message that's already marked \"Replied\", the previous
${indent}reply (if available) will be re-edited instead of a new reply being
${indent}created.

${bullet}Some new color schemes.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}The help window now survives a screen resize, instead of being closed.

${bullet}Killing a packet no longer forces a reread of the directory.

${bullet}The addressbook will no longer grab a new entry when no Fido address is
${indent}available. Also, the addresses are now sorted alphabetically on startup.
${indent}(Anything added during the session will not be alphabetized; however, the
${indent}list will be sorted again on the next startup.)

${bullet}The full length of Blue Wave \"To\" and \"From\" fields is now available in
${indent}the header editor. (Previously, they were restricted to 25 characters.)

${bullet}The subject sort in the letter list was not correctly performing the
${indent}secondary sort, by message number, in runs of the same subject.

${bullet}Time/date printout code changed in packet list and in Blue Wave reply
${indent}headers. I think this looks a bit better.

${bullet}The experimental Win32 console version had a problem with slow screen
${indent}output. This seems to be a problem with the console API (?), but it's
${indent}worked around in this version. (Normally, PDCurses checks for a keypress
${indent}after printing each line. In Win32, this call takes a noticeable amount
${indent}of time to return, even though it's supposed to be non-blocking. So, in
${indent}MultiMail, the check is disabled for the Win32 version. This also disables
${indent}typeahead, but I doubt anyone will even notice that.)

${bullet}A last attempt at fixing the remaining cursor problems in the PDCurses
${indent}versions. (The cursor size is now checked at startup, and that value is
${indent}explictly restored instead of using curs_set(1).) Scott Jones reported the
${indent}persiting problem in the OS/2 version.

${bullet}The index of the Personal area is now updated just by entering the letter
${indent}list, or anytime a message is read in that area. Better than previous
${indent}versions, though still not ideal.

${bullet}Support for the keypad plus, minus, and slash keys under PDCurses. (This
${indent}completes the keypad \"Enter\" fix in the previous version.)

${bullet}The experimental Win32 version supported only \"\\\" in the pathnames
${indent}specified in MMAIL.RC, where the DOS and OS/2 versions allowed either \"\\\"
${indent}or \"/\". Now both work in Win32, and both will be converted to \"\\\" when
${indent}MMAIL.RC is updated. Reported by Rafael Cresci.

${bullet}One more character allowed for unames in Blue Wave reply packets (six
${indent}instead of five). Specifically, that means \"MultiMail/MS-DOS\" and
${indent}\"MultiMail/NetBSD\" will now appear in Blue Wave tearlines, instead of the
${indent}abbreviated form \"MultiMail\".

${bullet}Hidden lines at the end of a message would cause the line count to be over
${indent}by one. Reported by Jim Hanoian.

${bullet}In the Save dialog, user-entered names were getting spaces converted to
${indent}underscores, though only the second time through (when the name was pulled
${indent}up as the default). Reported by J.H.
${ulend}
${h3}0.23 - 1999/01/22:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}QWKE and PCBoard-style \"Subject:\", \"To:\", and \"From:\" line kludges are now
${indent}supported in QWK mode, along with \"Title:\", which is used on WWIV. The
${indent}QWKE \"Subject:\" line is generated automatically for replies, if needed.
${indent}Note that in regular messages (though not in replies), these lines aren't
${indent}parsed until the message body is accessed by entering the letter window,
${indent}so the fields as shown in the letter list will at first be the short
${indent}forms.

${bullet}Reply forwarding -- press ${lt}CTRL${gt}-'F' while in the reply area (either the
${indent}letter list or letter window) to forward a reply. (Forwarding of regular
${indent}messages is not available yet.)

${bullet}In the REPLY area, 'R' now works as an alias for 'E'. Added at the
${indent}insistence of Jim Hanoian. :-)

${bullet}When (re-)editing or forwarding a reply, the area can now be changed.

${bullet}REPLY and PERSONAL areas now show the original area (as well as the
${indent}collection area) in the letter window. Suggested by J.H.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}New behavior in the ANSI viewer: Instead of resetting everything when a
${indent}screen-clearing code (${lt}ESC${gt}[2J) is encountered, it sets the last-drawn
${indent}line as the new baseline, and continues from there. With the old system,
${indent}information was sometimes lost (though it could still be viewed in the
${indent}animation mode); now, screens are simply chained together, and everything
${indent}is visible and scrollable.

${bullet}Characters 8 (backspace) and 12 (form feed) are now handled in the ANSI
${indent}viewer, and skipped in the letter window. Ctrl-Z is stripped in the ANSI
${indent}viewer.

${bullet}The BBS name and Sysop name fields in the info window of the area list
${indent}were being unnecessarily truncated.

${bullet}In the PDCurses versions, the cursor remained disabled when shelling to an
${indent}editor. Reported by Dane Beko. (Due to the way I implemented this fix,
${indent}PDCurses 2.2 is no longer acceptable for MultiMail; you must use 2.3.)

${bullet}When creating a .REP, a zero-length message body would cause a segfault.

${bullet}Blank space at the end of the little area list is now omitted (as in the
${indent}letter list).

${bullet}An attempt to send Netmail when no Netmail area is defined (as is always
${indent}the case in QWK mode) now pops up a nonFatalError window.

${bullet}The \"Save lastread pointers?\" message now comes up less often; the \"any
${indent}read\" flag is set less aggressively. (If you re-read a message that's
${indent}already marked as read, the any-read flag will not be set, as it was in
${indent}previous versions.)

${bullet}When entering areas which are fully read, the highlight bar is no longer
${indent}moved to the last message. Similarly, if the entire packet is marked as
${indent}read, the active area is not set to the last non-empty area, but the
${indent}first. Suggested by J.H.

${bullet}Hopefully, a better subject-line sort in the letter list: If two subjects
${indent}have the same content for the entire length of the shorter of the two, the
${indent}shorter one is no longer automatically placed first; instead, they're put
${indent}in message number order.

${bullet}The ENTER key on the numeric keypad did not work in the PDCurses versions.
${indent}Reported by Russell Tiedt.

${bullet}Added \"/m\" to the parameters passed to LHA in the MSDOS version. Without
${indent}this, it gave an \"Extension is not .lha. Continue? [Y/N]\" prompt when
${indent}archiving replies.
${ulend}
${h3}0.22 - 1999/01/01:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}The long-awaited support for new file lists and bulletins! They're
${indent}displayed automatically on opening the packet. Currently, this is a bit of
${indent}a kludge -- although I'm starting to like it. Memory usage is excessive.
${indent}(See the man page for more info.)

${bullet}Support for XCurses (the X port of PDCurses). See README.xc for details.

${bullet}Added a line counter to the ANSI window, as in the letter window.
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}If a tagline was displayed on screen, it would replace the tagline
${indent}selected for a reply via the tagline editor. This bug dates to 0.20.

${bullet}TAB characters that advanced past the end of a line were causing problems
${indent}in the ANSI viewer.

${bullet}Aborting a netmail reply left the netmail address set when a regular reply
${indent}was attempted afterwards.

${bullet}The translation toggle ('c') now works in all screens. (In particular, the
${indent}ANSI viewer.)

${bullet}Proper printing of character 127 (DEL) under ncurses.

${bullet}The SIGWINCH (resize) handler now works acceptably even when a SIGWINCH
${indent}occurs while in a WarningWindow() or getstring() call.
${ulend}
${h3}0.21 - 1998/12/15:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Not new, but newly documented: When run under Windows 95, the MSDOS
${indent}version supports long filenames! Apparently this is a feature of the DJGPP
${indent}standard library, though I didn't realize it before. (I don't know about
${indent}Win 98 or NT -- anybody else?)
${ulend}
Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}The code to generate the default tagline file was broken in 0.20, which
${indent}meant that all first-time users got a segfault. Argh! Also, since I was
${indent}messing with the taglines anyway, I changed the default list.

${bullet}In the PDCurses versions, the \"Could not uncompress packet\" and \"Packet
${indent}type not recognized\" messages would pop up without first restoring the
${indent}packet list screen. Also, some extra parentheses have been added around
${indent}color names for the benefit of PDCurses/Win32 (still an incomplete port).

${bullet}Updated the README.{DOS,OS2} files to reflect the new style of default
${indent}MMAIL.RC in use since 0.19.

${bullet}\"/\" and \".\" added to pop-up help window.
${ulend}
${h3}0.20 - 1998/12/06:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Search function. Case-insensitve searching is available everywhere. It's
${indent}still a bit limited, in that it only works within the current list (or
${indent}letter); i.e., you can't yet search multiple letters at once. Hit '/' to
${indent}bring up the text entry window and start the search, or '.' to repeat the
${indent}last search. (Yeah, I know -- it needs better keys.) Searching is from the
${indent}current line on down.

${bullet}Fido \"hidden\" message lines (marked with a ^A) can be displayed; 'X'
${indent}toggles this function.

${bullet}New features in the tagline editor and address book: New entries in the
${indent}address book are checked for dupes; also, tagline dupes, which were
${indent}already checked, are now reported. The address book and the tagline editor
${indent}allow you to Kill entries. And the tagline editor can be brought up
${indent}directly, via ^T, in the same way as the address book. Old features: The
${indent}reLoad function has been removed from the tagline editor.

${bullet}Rot13 function in letter window -- toggle with 'D'.

${bullet}If a new letter is not edited (as measured by the time stamp), you'll be
${indent}asked if you want to cancel it on returning to MultiMail. Partly inspired
${indent}by Gregory Paksi.

${bullet}Redundant colors can be omitted from the ColorFile. See colors/README.col
${indent}for details. Also, there are some new colors, and some old ones are gone;
${indent}be sure to check your ColorFile if you've customized it.

${bullet}Messages to or from you are highlighted in a different color in the letter
${indent}list. After Ingo Brueckl (though this implementation is a little different
${indent}from his).

${bullet}Read-only support for Blue Wave's .XTI files (last-read markers). This
${indent}means that any old packets you read with Blue Wave will be marked in the
${indent}same way when first opened in MultiMail; however, any changes made in
${indent}MultiMail will not be seen by Blue Wave. Partly inspired by I.B., but this
${indent}is a different (and more correct) implementation.

${bullet}\"Home\" and \"End\" keys are now available in text entry fields (i.e.,
${indent}ShadowedWin::getstring()). After I.B.${ulend}

Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}The FMPT kludge line is now supported, which means that in Blue Wave mode,
${indent}the netmail addresses of points will be recognized.

${bullet}Aborting a header edit from the letter list could cause a segfault. (The
${indent}fix in 0.19 was incomplete.)

${bullet}Some bogus ANSI codes (mainly, \"ESC[?7h\") are now semi-interpreted, so
${indent}they no longer clutter the screen. Also, the ANSI background color is now
${indent}hardwired to white on black, instead of being set by Main_Back.

${bullet}The highlight method for the active line was no good on a light background
${indent}with ncurses 4.2 (was ok with 4.1). Some other changes for light
${indent}backgrounds, too.

${bullet}High-bit, \"low-bit\" (below 32) and certain special characters are now
${indent}handled better by MultiMail, being actually printed instead of interpreted
${indent}as control codes. :-) Particularly useful for ANSI.

${bullet}TAB characters are now rendered as the appropriate number of spaces in the
${indent}letter and ANSI windows.

${bullet}In text entry fields (getstring()), high-bit characters were showing up
${indent}with weird attributes (due to a sign error). Reported (indirectly) by
${indent}I.B., this bug has been present since about 0.10! I'm suprised no one from
${indent}Fido zone 2 mentioned it to me before.

${bullet}Packets can now be renamed without MultiMail losing track of its last read
${indent}markers. (This will, however, still result in a second .red file being
${indent}created.)

${bullet}When entering a tagline manually via \"E\" in the tagline editor, the
${indent}entry field is now placed correctly, instead of appearing to overwrite the
${indent}last tagline. Also, bogus taglines are no longer generated from message
${indent}lines which are just \"...\".

${bullet}In the Reply area, the help menu for the letter list was showing a 'K'
${indent}where it should've been an 'S'. Also, capitalization in help menus has
${indent}been standardized (only the keys that activate commands are in caps in the
${indent}descriptive text), and the pop-up letter help window is now in two
${indent}columns.

${bullet}Killing an item (in any menu) now moves down to the next entry, regardless
${indent}of the position in the list (unless at the end).

${bullet}The 'L' command now remains available in the address book after a screen
${indent}resize (SIGWINCH). Also, taking an address via 'L' automatically sets the
${indent}active line to the last position (where the new entry is).

${bullet}Netmail addresses are now included in Saved letters.

${bullet}The resize (SIGWINCH) handler was causing a segfault in some
${indent}circumstances. Although I just noticed it, this bug dates to 0.18.
${indent}Curiously, it occurred for me only when running under \"screen\". The fix
${indent}was to change Win::inkey() to remove the loop.

${bullet}Changed the .mmailrc separators from \" = \" back to \": \", which makes
${indent}them compatible with 0.18 and earlier. I'll probably change them again. (I
${indent}was trying to achieve a more \"classic\" style of .rc file, but in fact,
${indent}it still wasn't quite right.)

${bullet}The cursor was not being disabled in PDCurses versions.

${bullet}\"Read\" indicator in the letter window was not updated after Saving.

${bullet}Changed interface/Makefile and mmail/Makefile to allow \"make clean\" to
${indent}work in DOS. Suggested by I.B.

${bullet}And of course, various internal changes.${ulend}

${h3}0.19 - 1998/10/25:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}The .mmailrc has been redesigned. New versions of MultiMail will update it
${indent}automatically; comments will be lost, but old data will be preseved. Note:
${indent}the new form is not readable by 0.18 or earlier, because of the use of '='
${indent}as a separator. Partly inspired by Ingo Brueckl.

${bullet}Non-fatal errors. Currently, this is used only for the previously fatal
${indent}\"Could not uncompress packet\" and \"Packet type not recognized\".

${bullet}You can change the colors MultiMail uses without recompiling. See the
${indent}automatically generated \"~/colors\" for details; also, some sample color
${indent}schemes are included in the 0.19 archive. This feature is due largely to
${indent}Ingo Brueckl.

${bullet}\"Marked\" messages are kept in the active letter list, whether read or
${indent}unread. In combination with the \"Save\" changes (see below), this means
${indent}that marking is now actually useful. :-)

${bullet}Extensive changes to the \"Save\" dialog: When you Save from the letter
${indent}list, you're given a choice of \"All\", \"This one\", or \"Quit\"; if any
${indent}messages are marked, you also get the option \"Marked\". Saving \"All\"
${indent}now saves all messages in the active list, rather than all in the area.
${indent}(To get the old behavior, just toggle the full list on first.) Saving a
${indent}message sets the \"Read\" flag, and turns off \"Marked\". The last-entered
${indent}filename is retained (separately) for \"All\", \"This One\", and
${indent}\"Marked\". If no name is entered manually, the automatic name is
${indent}regenerated with each use; otherwise, the manual name is kept until you
${indent}exit MultiMail.${ulend}

Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Segfaults in saving All, in some cases.

${bullet}Certain ANSI pics, with codes in the form \"${lt}ESC${gt}[;27H\" (i.e., with
${indent}an empty parameter before a semicolon) were causing segfaults.

${bullet}After the cursor was turned on, e.g. by the Save window or an aborted
${indent}message header edit, it was left in the middle of the screen on some
${indent}terminals. It is now forced down to the corner.

${bullet}The header editor was being left on screen after exiting via ESC.

${bullet}Removed the text \"Fatal Error\" from fatal errors. :-) It was sometimes
${indent}redundant, and other times wrong.

${bullet}When the last packet was deleted from the packet list, a segfault could
${indent}occur. Reported by Alan Ianson.

${bullet}Functions which redrew the letter window (e.g., toggling character set
${indent}translation) were setting the Read marker each time.

${bullet}The tagline window now looks better on screens other than 80 columns.

${bullet}Various internal changes, and added comments.${ulend}

${h3}0.18 - 1998/08/14:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}MultiMail can now read QWK packets without .NDX files. Partly inspired by
${indent}Simon Callan. Note: It's still preferable to include them, since it takes
${indent}about three times longer to open the packet without them. (But that's not
${indent}counting the unpacking time, which is much longer still.)

${bullet}The letter list now allows toggling between showing all messages, and
${indent}showing only those which are unread; when entering an area, it defaults to
${indent}unread (unless all the messages are marked read). I've found that this
${indent}makes a BIG difference in the feel of the program -- it's more like a
${indent}newsreader now. ;-) Use the 'L' key to toggle between the long and short
${indent}lists (as in the area list).${ulend}

Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Removed a lot of redundant code from the interface section, and
${indent}reorganized it... There are many new features that need implementing, but
${indent}so far I've been concentrating on cleaning up and simplifying the existing
${indent}code, so as to have a solid base to build on. I think I'm almost there.
${indent};-)

${bullet}Found a couple small memory leaks, in AnsiWindow (the statbar was not
${indent}being deleted) and main_read_class. Also, the tagline file was being left
${indent}open after reading it.

${bullet}Now gives a fatal error (instead of segfaulting) if the screen is smaller
${indent}than 60x20.

${bullet}The address book and tagline window now respond correctly to SIGWINCH.

${bullet}In the tagline window, the key for rereading the file has been changed
${indent}from 'F' to 'L'. This allows 'F' to be used as an alias for PgDn, as on
${indent}other screens. (The real purpose was to merge the code into the rest of
${indent}the keyboard-handling code.)

${bullet}If there was only one area (i.e., REPLY), and the right arrow was pressed,
${indent}an infinite loop would occur. Reported by Tamminen Eero.

${bullet}The 'N' key, for Netmail, is now disabled when no Netmail area is
${indent}available. Partly inspired by Fran${ccedil}ois Thunus.

${bullet}Sample filenames in the default .mmailrc now conform to the OS (i.e., 8.3
${indent}(FAT) format for DOS and OS/2), and the unused \"ReadDir\" line has been
${indent}removed. Inspired by F.T.

${bullet}Stripping and adding of blank lines at the end of messages works a little
${indent}better now, but still needs work.

${bullet}The addressbook was crashing, when empty (0 items). Reported by Marc D.
${indent}Williams.${ulend}

${h3}0.17 - 1998/07/06:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Netmail addresses, when present in Blue Wave packets (or reply packets),
${indent}are displayed in the From: or To: fields in the letter window, as
${indent}appropriate; and when entering a netmail message, the address can now be
${indent}edited. (Note: Netmail is largely untested yet.)

${bullet}In the header editor (From, To, etc.), you can now use the up and down
${indent}arrows to move between fields, or press ESC in any field to abort the
${indent}edit. Press ENTER on the last field to exit normally.

${bullet}Reading a message in the QWK Personal area marks it as read in its
${indent}original area.

${bullet}A full area list is now available in both QWK and Blue Wave modes; it can
${indent}be toggled by pressing 'L' in the area list. (The compile-time
${indent}\"shortlist\" definition has been removed.) One benefit is that you can
${indent}enter a message in any area, even when only the short list is being
${indent}displayed.

${bullet}When re-editing a message, you can now edit the header as well as the
${indent}text.

${bullet}ANSI animation. While in the ANSI viewer, press one of the ANSI activation
${indent}keys again (or 'A') to see an animated view. Press any key to abort the
${indent}animation.

${bullet}The ANSI viewer supports the screen-clearing code.

${bullet}The cursor is turned off, wherever possible. Less visual clutter. :-)

${bullet}True scrolling instead of redrawing; minimized the redrawing done for
${indent}letter window, ANSI viewer, and all ListWindows. It's now MUCH faster on
${indent}slow machines and slow terminals.${ulend}

Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}MASSIVE rewrite... Almost everything that was crufty in previous versions
${indent}is now done the right way. :-) General fixes include: plugging memory
${indent}leaks (there were a lot of these, I'm sorry to say), elimination of
${indent}one-based arrays, adding more limit checks, and removal of all kinds of
${indent}kludges and redundant code. The interface is more fully separate from the
${indent}specific drivers; adding new packet types now requires changing only
${indent}mmail/driverl.cc.

${bullet}The netmail area is found by attribute rather than name, and (owing to the
${indent}full area list now available in Blue Wave mode) can always be found,
${indent}instead of only when you have received netmail. :-)

${bullet}Character set translation is applied to the area list, and to area
${indent}descriptions in the letter list and letter window.

${bullet}The number of replies shown in the REPLY area is updated immediately when
${indent}it changes.

${bullet}The method of adding blanks before taglines and tearlines is changed; it
${indent}should no longer be necessary to type an extra CR at the end of replies.

${bullet}QWK replies are automatically word-wrapped at 80 columns, if they're not
${indent}wrapped already. (In Blue Wave, this is not desirable. QWK doors seem to
${indent}prefer individual lines; Blue Wave, paragraphs.)

${bullet}MultiMail now ensures that QWK replies end with a line-ending character,
${indent}instead of letting the last line run off into the padding area. Without
${indent}this, certain QWK doors would strip off the tearline.

${bullet}The path is no longer displayed in the Save window, and the suggested
${indent}filename is conformed to FAT (8.3) standards. Note that you can still
${indent}enter any pathname, and any filename that will be accepted by your system.

${bullet}Specifying pathnames that end in a slash or backslash (e.g., in .mmailrc)
${indent}should now work correctly.

${bullet}The extraneous \"bw\" prefix found on many of the .mmailrc variable names
${indent}is no longer needed, though it will still be recognized for backwards
${indent}compatibility.

${bullet}Space bar now works in the little area list.

${bullet}The QWK \"Personal\" area no longer appears in the little area list, nor
${indent}can messages be entered in it from the area list.

${bullet}Unrecognized packets no longer cause a segfault (just an exit).

${bullet}Added trivial SIGWINCH handlers for AddressBook and TaglineWindow (they
${indent}just exit that menu).

${bullet}Fatal errors are now reported correctly in the OS/2 version, even when
${indent}they occur before curses initialization.

${bullet}In the ANSI viewer, there are no more segfaults in OS/2, and no more stray
${indent}characters on the status line in either PDCurses version.

${bullet}ANSI Reverse attribute now works with PDCurses.

${bullet}ANSI viewing works in reply area.

${bullet}A SIGWINCH can no longer result in the active (highlighted) line being
${indent}displaced off the screen.

${bullet}New default LHA parameters for MSDOS version (the Unix ones didn't work
${indent}for it).

${bullet}The currently selected address is preserved between calls to the
${indent}AddressBook.${ulend}

${h3}0.16 - 1998/05/28:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}This version compiles for OS/2, with EMX. This entailed substantial
${indent}changes to the Makefile (q.v.), as well as some code.

${bullet}The environment variable MMAIL can now be used instead of HOME, to specify
${indent}the directory of the .mmailrc (or mmail.rc) file. If neither variable is
${indent}defined, MultiMail will use the current directory (this is also new).

${bullet}The DOS-to-Latin 1 character table has been improved, for translation of
${indent}graphics characters, by stealing most of the table from DOSEmu.

${bullet}Truly automatic packet recognition, by packet contents instead of name.
${indent}Patch by Robert Vukovic.

${bullet}Internal ANSI viewer. Works on all platforms (except that it sometimes
${indent}segfaults when scrolling, under OS/2). Much better than the \"less\"
${indent}viewer, and it will form the basis of new file list and bulletin
${indent}viewers.${ulend}

Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Another big bug in the DOS version (argh!): Last read markers were not
${indent}being saved. This bug was the result of an error in the bug fix in 0.15.
${indent}:-/ I'm surprised no one has reported this.

${bullet}In the previous DOS versions, under some arrangements of directories, the
${indent}temporary directories would not be removed.

${bullet}The man page has been renamed to \"mm.1\", and the title changed, so that
${indent}\"man\" and \"apropos\" will work more appropriately. The install will
${indent}make a link to the old name (mmail.1).

${bullet}The \"Replied\" flag is now set by O- and N-type replies, as well as R.

${bullet}Some code reorganization.${ulend}

${h3}0.15 - 1998/05/12:${h3end}

New feature:${pul}

${bullet}If you back out from a packet, to the packet list, you can now reselect
${indent}the same packet without it being decompressed again. Thanks to Robert
${indent}Vukovic for convincing me of the need for something like this.${ulend}

Bug fix:${pul}

${bullet}In DOS, the default editor (edit.com) didn't actually work, because it
${indent}didn't understand paths with slashes instead of backslashes. I missed this
${indent}because it worked with Qedit. :-) The slashes are now flipped on the
${indent}pathnames passed to external editors and archivers (in DOS only). Thanks
${indent}to kifox@geocities.com for reporting the problem.${ulend}

${h3}0.14 - 1998/04/25:${h3end}

Bug fix:${pul}

${bullet}A more subtle line-ending bug... under MSDOS, extra characters were
${indent}sometimes added to the end of a reply. (Unix versions were not
${indent}affected.)${ulend}

${h3}0.13 - 1998/04/24:${h3end}

Bug fix:${pul}

${bullet}While making changes to accomodate MSDOS line endings, I made a small
${indent}oversight that caused replies to be truncated at one character if they
${indent}were re-edited.${ulend}

${h3}0.12 - 1998/04/23:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Compatible with MSDOS. All source code files have been changed to
${indent}single-case, 8.3 form, and #ifdef's are used on filenames internally where
${indent}necessary. (Most other issues are taken care of by DJGPP, though some
${indent}Makefile changes were necessary, and the starting directory is now
${indent}restored on termination -- needed in DOS, but not in Unix.)

${bullet}Compatible with PDCurses (as distributed with DJGPP), and SysV curses
${indent}(specifically, Solaris). Note that the shadows on windows are opaque if
${indent}you compile with SysV curses. (I also added \"#define USE_SHADOWS\", which
${indent}you can comment out or remove to get rid of the shadows
${indent}altogether.)${ulend}

Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}After the reorganization of resource.C in version 0.11 (if not before),
${indent}any change to the value of mmHomeDir in .mmailrc would leave the
${indent}bwPacketDir, bwReplyDir, etc. variables unaffacted.

${bullet}memError() now works correctly, even before initialization of the
${indent}interface. Fatal errors in general will be reported better in this
${indent}version.

${bullet}Some additonal bounds checking on sprintf() calls.

${bullet}tmpnam() checked. In principle, as few as 26 temporary filenames might be
${indent}available from it (which should still be enough, unless you write a whole
${indent}lot of replies).${ulend}

${h3}0.11 - 1998/03/21:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Area and system descriptions added to saved messages.

${bullet}I removed the last remaining command-line option, \"-m\", on the grounds
${indent}that it was useless. (This is a new UNfeature.) After testing it on my
${indent}9600 bps terminal, it doesn't appear to improve the speed; and the
${indent}alternate color scheme, which it was originally designed to select, was
${indent}never implemented. (Instead, I've added inversing to the top and bottom
${indent}bars in the letter window, and made a few other changes to make it more
${indent}monochrome-friendly.)${ulend}

Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}resource.C and resource.h rewritten and simplified to allow compilation
${indent}with gcc 2.8.1. (It's not yet clear to me why the old version didn't work,
${indent}but this is better anyway.) There are still a few warnings, but it works
${indent}OK.

${bullet}When entering the From:, To:, and Subject: on replies, the full width of
${indent}the fields had not been available. Under some circumstances, this could
${indent}even cause a segfault. These lengths still need to be checked more
${indent}stringently.

${bullet}Automatic \"Re:\" adding now takes place before subject-line editing,
${indent}instead of after. This allows users to see that it will be added, and to
${indent}override it if desired. (It also saves a few bytes of code!) I don't know
${indent}why I did it the other way before.

${bullet}In the event of a \"Fatal Error:\" exit, MultiMail will now clean up after
${indent}itself, as with normal exits. Also, failed memory allocation is now
${indent}explicitly checked.

${bullet}Default paths for \"zip\" and \"unzip\" removed. (These would only show up
${indent}if the paths were not defined in the .mmailrc -- as they are with the
${indent}default .mmailrc.) Thanks to Carey Bloodworth for pointing this out.

${bullet}If the message numbers exceeded 5 digits (i.e., 100000+), they would mess
${indent}up the display in the letter list. Now, it takes 6. :-)

${bullet}Much internal reorganization.

${bullet}Fixed a bug with my website -- the new-style URL (/~wmcbrine/) messed up
${indent}some relative pathnames. :-)${ulend}

${h3}0.10 - 1998/03/07:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Shadowed windows! Tell me if you like them.

${bullet}SIGWINCH support. You can now resize the terminal (e.g., maximize the
${indent}xterm) while MultiMail is running, and it will adapt to the new
${indent}size.${ulend}

Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Under Solaris, the help menu area was not being cleared when changing from
${indent}one menu to another.

${bullet}One more space available in letter list (now consistent with the other
${indent}lists).

${bullet}On some systems (such as Linux w/ glibc, and NetBSD), if you attempted to
${indent}read a packet that didn't already have a \"bbsid.red\" file (mm's read
${indent}markers) in it, MultiMail v0.9 would segfault right after unzipping a
${indent}packet, due to a very stupid attempt to call fclose() with a NULL pointer.
${indent}Under Linux w/ libc.5, this actually worked OK; and I didn't notice it on
${indent}my NetBSD test system because the packets there already had .red files in
${indent}them. Thanks again to Cesar Cardoso for reporting the problem.${par}

${indent}Due to the seriousness of this bug, I'm releasing v0.10 early.${ulend}

${h3}0.9 - 1998/02/26:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Added alias, \"!\", for F2. Added Tab as an alias for right arrow (next
${indent}unread) in letter list.

${bullet}Better handling of screen widths other than 80; better use of available
${indent}screen space even in 80 columns. Still to do: handle SIGWINCH.

${bullet}QWK now has the option (on by default) to show only those areas which have
${indent}messages in them, instead of the full area list. I set this on by default
${indent}to match the behavior of the Blue Wave side; you can change this in the
${indent}top-level Makefile. Currently, it's only a compile-time option. (In the
${indent}future, I'll add the ability to do a full list in Blue Wave mode, and to
${indent}toggle the mode at runtime.)

${bullet}.REP and .NEW filenames are now forced to lowercase. Should be easier to
${indent}type. :-) But if you have any uppercase-named reply packets from previous
${indent}versions, you'll have to manually rename them before 0.9 will recognize
${indent}them. Sorry.

${bullet}Blue Wave mode now works on big-endian systems! The full functionality of
${indent}MultiMail is now available on all platforms where it compiles. And
${indent}\"-fpack-struct\" is no longer needed in the Makefile -- which I hope may
${indent}mean increased portability.

${bullet}system() calls to rm and sed have been eliminated.${ulend}

Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Strip spaces from Blue Wave subject lines; fixes sorting in some cases.

${bullet}In Blue Wave mode, MultiMail was using LF as a paragraph delimiter. The
${indent}correct behavior is to use CR as the delimiter and ignore any LFs. Thanks
${indent}to Marc D. Williams for submitting a packet that required this fix.

${bullet}Messages in Blue Wave packets are supposed to have a leading space, but
${indent}packets produced by the ReneWave door lacked them. They also contained
${indent}nulls in messages (a no-no). MultiMail now deals with these problems
${indent}without flaking out. Thanks again to M.D.W.

${bullet}With Blue Wave packets, MultiMail now scans for \"*.inf\", instead of
${indent}assuming that the packet name minus the extension is the basename.
${indent}Normally, that is the case, but the \"welcome!.000\" packet that comes
${indent}with the Blue Wave reader -- which uses \"welcome\" internally -- is a
${indent}counterexample. MultiMail can now read this packet. :-)

${bullet}Startup for QWK packets is much faster, especially on slow systems.
${indent}Previous versions would attempt to open the .ndx file for each area
${indent}defined in the control.dat (and would do so several times for each area),
${indent}whether it existed or not; 0.9 scans to see which .ndx files actually
${indent}exist first.

${bullet}Changed ANSI viewer to work better with certain messages. Really, I should
${indent}make it user-definable, instead of being hard-wired to \"less\"; but I'm
${indent}probably going to make it into an internal function anyway.

${bullet}Added \"#include ${lt}sys/types.h${gt}\" to mmail/mmail.h. Usually I wouldn't
${indent}mention a change of this type, but in this case, it was done to get
${indent}MultiMail to compile with glibc (libc 6). Thanks to Cesar Cardoso for
${indent}reporting the problem and testing the solution.

${bullet}Saved messages are now wrapped at 80 columns, regardless of screen width
${indent}at the time of saving; and the date is now added to the saved header.

${bullet}Replying to a message no longer messes up the right margin of the original
${indent}when viewing it immediately after replying.

${bullet}Paths are no longer stored with the .red file when using LHA. In previous
${indent}versions, this could cause the storing of multiple .red files into a
${indent}packet.

${bullet}Next/previous unread in letter list now work correctly, even with messages
${indent}that have manually been marked Unread.

${bullet}Miscellaneous minor internal fixes and optimizations.${ulend}

${h3}0.8 - 1998/02/10:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}\"Re: \" is stripped from subject lines, for sorting and display purposes,
${indent}and added automatically on replies (unless doing so would truncate the
${indent}subject). Subject sorting is now case-insensitive.

${bullet}Letter window now displays \"bbsnum (x of y)\", for consistency with the
${indent}letter list and to provide more information.

${bullet}Slightly expanded the area description length to make better use of the
${indent}available space. Also, in the letter list, more of the subject is shown.

${bullet}Restored the \"line/lines\" counter found in early versions of MultiMail.
${indent}This shows the length of the message in lines, and the number of the top
${indent}line on screen.

${bullet}Temporary files are now cleared at the end of a session. Also, since
${indent}MultiMail now generates a unique temporary directory for each session, a
${indent}single user can run multiple concurrent sessions. (Just don't try to read
${indent}the same packet in each one!)

${bullet}System uname added to Blue Wave tearline (if it will fit).

${bullet}Character set translation can now be toggled at runtime, by pressing 'c',
${indent}instead of at compilation time.

${bullet}Packet type is now recognized automatically, based on the filename's
${indent}extension. (You can still force the other type.) Consequently, the \"-b\"
${indent}and \"-q\" options have been removed.

${bullet}The Blue Wave area list now uses the description instead of the echotag.
${indent}This is much more useful, and conforms to the Blue Wave reader.

${bullet}The number of the original message is now passed to the door for reply
${indent}linking.

${bullet}In the letter window, the top and bottom bars are now inversed when in
${indent}monochrome. In the various lists, the highlight bar is now drawn with
${indent}stdout(), for greater contrast.

${bullet}Many changes to the top-level Makefile; it's now more portable, and
${indent}commented. You can now set the location of the ncurses header file here,
${indent}instead of editing the source.

${bullet}The packet list is now sorted, and shows file sizes as well as dates.

${bullet}The backquote character (\`) is converted to an ESC when using the ANSI
${indent}viewer. (Some systems recode ESC characters this way.)

${bullet}You can now Kill packets from the packet list.${ulend}

Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}If all preexisting replies were deleted, attempting to create a new reply
${indent}during the same session could cause a segfault.

${bullet}Terminal newlines stripped from replies. Conforms to the Blue Wave reader;
${indent}supresses gaps after the tagline with some doors.

${bullet}QWK subject fields had been truncated at 24 characters. (The field is 25
${indent}chars.)

${bullet}The tagline file can now be hand-edited without introducing blank lines.

${bullet}In the letter window, PgDn, End, and the down arrow now stop at the actual
${indent}end of the text.

${bullet}No more extra junk in Blue Wave reply packets.

${bullet}Blue Wave replies can now be safely reedited. (Previously, the line
${indent}endings could be messed up -- left in Unix format.) Stray characters no
${indent}longer appear at the end of Blue Wave replies while viewing them.

${bullet}Blue Wave mode, like QWK mode, now shows the BBS message numbers in the
${indent}letter list, instead of the messages' position in the packet.

${bullet}Trailing \", Sysop\" stripped from sysop name in QWK mode.

${bullet}Opening reply packets that were generated by the Blue Wave reader caused a
${indent}segfault, due to case mismatch; it now works correctly.

${bullet}Version number \"encryption\" for Blue Wave replies fixed (so the number
${indent}appears correctly in tearlines). (IMO, the Blue Wave specs are in error in
${indent}describing this feature -- bluewave.h refers to addition when it should
${indent}say subtraction.)

${bullet}Left and right arrow keys in the area list now work much faster when
${indent}skipping empty areas, and can take you to the first and last areas,
${indent}instead of second and next-to-last.

${bullet}Killed the stupid repeating-REPLY-area bug in Blue Wave mode.

${bullet}When creating Blue Wave replies, MultiMail now makes the proper choice
${indent}between \"real name\" and \"alias\", depending on the area flags.${ulend}

${h3}0.7 - 1997/12/07:${h3end}

New features:${pul}

${bullet}Right and left arrow keys now select next/previous unread message in an
${indent}area, similarly to the way they function in the area list (jumping to
${indent}non-empty areas).

${bullet}ANSI viewer. Hit ^A while reading a message to view it in color, if it has
${indent}ANSI codes embedded. This is still rudimentary; it uses \"less\" as the
${indent}viewer, and it depends on the terminal to interpret the codes.

${bullet}Private flag support. Complete, except for Blue Wave area flag checks.

${bullet}Character set translation is essentially complete. The only further
${indent}changes I envision are the ability to turn translation on or off at run
${indent}time, instead of at compile time; some possible changes to the translation
${indent}table; and maybe additional character sets.

${bullet}Stolen taglines are checked for dupes, included only once.

${bullet}With some minor changes, I got it to work under SunOS (Solaris). No longer
${indent}just a Linux program! :-) So, the tearline is now derived from the uname.
${indent}Blue Wave mode still requires a little-endian system.

${bullet}QWK \"Personal\" conference.

${bullet}Many key aliases added, mainly for use on terminals that don't support
${indent}keys like PgDn and F1. Also, Space Bar now functions as a combination
${indent}PgDn/Enter in the letter window, to allow paging through a conference.

${bullet}Marking and read/unread toggle now work from the letter list, simplifying
${indent}bulk marking. In the REPLY area, Kill now works from the letter list.

${bullet}Automatic creation of .mmailrc and the mmail directories; no more \"make
${indent}install_dirs\".

${bullet}Changed bluewave.h to version 3. (No related feature changes yet.) I now
${indent}use it in unmodified form; \"-fpack-struct\" is sufficient.${ulend}

Bug fixes and such:${pul}

${bullet}Suppression of \"hidden\" text lines added for Blue Wave (already present
${indent}for QWK).

${bullet}Append saved files instead of overwrite.

${bullet}If saving without a path specified, save in the \"save\" directory.

${bullet}Better adaptation to nonstandard screen sizes.

${bullet}Really random taglines (previously, there was no call to srand).

${bullet}\"Save lastread pointers?\" and \"Reply area has changed...\" messages now
${indent}come up only when appropriate.

${bullet}\"Personal\" column in area list removed in QWK mode. Maybe not a bug, but
${indent}it was unused.

${bullet}Fall back to login name if no alias name defined. (It was using only the
${indent}alias name, sometimes leading to blank From: lines in Blue Wave mode. This
${indent}feature needs more work -- the alias should not always be the default.)

${bullet}Various date fixes (QWK and Blue Wave).

${bullet}Print the right area type for QWK Replies.

${bullet}Area names padded out with spaces when necessary to correct a cosmetic
${indent}defect in the REPLIES/PERSONAL letter lists' \"Area\" fields.

${bullet}Version number references made consistent.

${bullet}Remove extra bytes from ends of messages (QWK and Blue Wave).

${bullet}A big one: Kill the *correct* reply messages with 'K'. (!)

${bullet}A BIG one: QWK reply area numbers fixed. It was using the internal area
${indent}number, rather than the QWK number; so replies would go to the wrong
${indent}areas! (Under specific conditions -- a packet with conferences that were
${indent}numbered serially, starting from zero -- this would actually work right,
${indent}which is doubtless how the bug snuck in to begin with.)

${bullet}Stop truncating replies. (This bug complimented the extra byte bug,
${indent}preventing segfaults in the old version.)

${bullet}I changed the default directories from \"bwdown\", etc., to \"down\", etc.
${indent}This wasn't a bug, but it was too Blue Wave-centric for a dual-function
${indent}reader. (I believe the original intent of K.T. & T.I. was that the QWK
${indent}implementation would have its own directories, e.g., \"qwkdown\";  but as
${indent}implemented by J.Z., a common directory was used. I may revert to the
${indent}putative original design at some point. Internally, the \"bw\"  prefix is
${indent}still used on many shared structures.)

${bullet}Make .REP packets from the BBSID, not the base packetname.

${bullet}\"Unread\" now counts all messages marked unread, not just those which are
${indent}also unmarked and unreplied.

${bullet}Letter sort fixed (now sorts by number within each subject), and faster.

${bullet}Eliminated the defaulting to \"reply\" when an otherwise undefined key was
${indent}pressed.

${bullet}Calls to todos replaced with internal code.

${bullet}QWK .ndx parser replaced with faster, non-endian-dependent version.

${bullet}Many ncurses changes. Most importantly, shells and (normal) exits now
${indent}restore the screen mode. (Error exits still need fixing.)

${bullet}Makefile changes (including centralizing options in top-level Makefile).
${indent}Could do with a bit more changing, I think.

${bullet}A big one (since it prevented me from even using 0.6, as it was): Fixed
${indent}segfaults on opening packets with uppercase names within (i.e., those from
${indent}most or all DOS-based BBSes).

${bullet}Many minor changes to suppress warning messages during compilation.

${bullet}Many, many more. :-) These are just the user-visible ones.${ulend}

Bugs unfixed:${pul}

${bullet}The lockup-on-exit bug, described below as having appeared in 0.3 and
${indent}disappeared in 0.4, has resurfaced. I too am unable to trace it. It can
${indent}come or go after almost any random change in the code.${ulend}

${h3}0.6a - 1997/03/25:${h3end}${pul}

${bullet}Oops! The signature was in the wrong place. Right order is: signature,
${indent}tagline, tearline ;-)

${bullet}Tagline adoption is supported! (Doesn't check dupe tags yet.)

${bullet}QWK-reply packs contained '\\\n' as a line terminator. It's incorrect! We
${indent}have to use softCR (char#227).

${bullet}Character conversion is somewhat in! For ISO 8859-1 ${lt}--${gt} CP437 (DOS)
${indent}translation, #define ISOCONVERT in /interface/interface.h

${bullet}ISO conversion doesn't do the from/to/subj yet${ulend}

${h3}0.5a - 1997/03/22:${h3end}${pul}

${bullet}Fixed another date bug (when reloading QWK replies, the date would be
${indent}mangled).

${bullet}You can now use a signature file after each letter (specify its filename
${indent}in .mmailrc)

${bullet}Says error, if ~/.mmailrc isn't found. (The program needs this file!)

${bullet}File open errors printed, inside a BW/QWK packet, it tries four variations
${indent}of the filename (eg. mybbs.dat, MYBBS.dat, MYBBS.DAT, mybbs.DAT).

${bullet}The annoying bug, which occurred when quitting, has disappeared!
${indent};-o${ulend}

${h3}0.4a - 1997/03/12:${h3end}${pul}

${bullet}Fixed the date handling with QWK packets. Should do it well. That part
${indent}wasn't even implemented before.

${bullet}Colors should be fine now, everywhere.

${bullet}One small, but ANNOYING bug introduced: the program doesn't exit properly,
${indent}sometimes you have to kill it! Sorry, couldn't trace this bug yet. Maybe
${indent}you can help.${ulend}

${h3}0.3alpha - 1997/02/16:${h3end}${pul}

${bullet}Took out many more bugs. This version now is almost usable ;)

${bullet}You can now (re)Edit your reply!

${bullet}Major design and color changes... Still not done, but doing good!

${bullet}Added message Marking, Read/Unread toggle.${ulend}

${h3}0.2alpha - 1997/02/12:${h3end}${pul}

${bullet}Debugged the program, fixed lots'a bugs, added QWK support. Only a
