Revisions for newest version of PDCurses -- fewer ifdefs needed. Note 
that MultiMail now must be compiled with PDCurses 2.7 or later.

Changed some compiler options to work better with recent gcc. 
Unfortunately it bloats the executable.

Removed the distinction between Bulletins and New file lists, so there's 
only one prompt to bother you with now.

Minor code cleanup.
