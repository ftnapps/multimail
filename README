What is MultiMail?
------------------

MultiMail is an offline mail packet reader for Unix and other systems.
(This version also compiles under MSDOS, with DJGPP or Turbo C++; OS/2,
with EMX; Win32, with RSX/NT or Borland C++; BeOS and AtheOS.) It currently
supports the Blue Wave, QWK, OMEN, SOUP and OPX formats. It uses a simple
curses-based interface.

MultiMail is free, "open source" software, distributed under the GNU
General Public License (q.v.).

Tested Systems
--------------

I'd like to get MultiMail tested on as many platforms as possible. I've
personally used it on:

Operating Systems:  Linux, Solaris, NetBSD, DOS, OS/2, Windows, BeOS,
                    FreeBSD, AtheOS, MacOS X
Processors:         i386, Sparc, m68k, Alpha, i86, PPC
Compilers:          GCC (including DJGPP, EMX, and RSXNT), Compaq Alpha
                    (w/ GNU make), Borland/Turbo C++
Libraries:          ncurses, Solaris curses, PDCurses

If you get it going on a dissimilar system, please let me know (along with
any necessary patches). Or, let me telnet to your machine, and I'll try
porting it myself. :-)
