MultiMail version 0.32
======================

What is MultiMail?
------------------

MultiMail is an offline mail packet reader for Unix and other systems.
(This version also compiles under MSDOS, with DJGPP; OS/2, with EMX; and
Win32, with RSX/NT.) It currently supports the Blue Wave, QWK, OMEN, SOUP
and OPX (Silver Xpress) formats. It has a full screen, color user
interface, built with the curses library.

MultiMail is free, "open source" software, distributed under the GNU
General Public License (q.v.).

You can get the latest version by anonymous ftp from:

Sorry, but no official Fidonet netmail address or F'REQ site is available
right now.

  Linux 2.0.33, Red Hat, Pentium, gcc 2.7.2.1, ncurses 1.9.9e
